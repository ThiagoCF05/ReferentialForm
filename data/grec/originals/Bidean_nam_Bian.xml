Beinn Fhada is separated from Gearr Aonach by a glen known as Coire Gabhail. This translates to Glen of Capture, however the glen is more normally known as the Hidden or Lost Valley. Either name may be considered appropriate since it is believed that in former times the valley was used by members of Clan Macdonald to hide stolen cattle. The glen is ideal for this purpose since it is blocked by a glacial landslip, and from Glen Coe appears as a narrow gorge. In fact, once past the landslip the floor of the glen is wide and flat â€“ ideal for cattle. The path from Glen Coe through the gorge into Coire Gabhail is a popular short walk (around 4 km in total), though it is rough in places.</PARAGRAPH>
