 is the high point of the Big Hatchet Mountains, a small but rugged range in the southwest corner (the "Bootheel") of New Mexico, in the United States. The mountains are located in Hidalgo County, about 50 mi (80 km) southwest of Deming. The range runs roughly northwest-southeast, and is about 12 mi (20 km) long; the southeastern edge of the range is within 5 mi (8 km) of the border with Mexico. They lie primarily on BLM land.
