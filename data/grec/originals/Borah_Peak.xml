The normal route on the southwest ridge is a strenuous hike for the most part until one reaches an arÃªte just before the main summit crest. This point is known as "Chickenout Ridge" as many people will abort the attempt once they see the hazards up close. This dangerous crossing involves a traverse over snow, with steeply slanting slopes on either side. An ice axe is strongly recommended for this section. Parties should turn back if there is any doubt about being able to make the crossing.
