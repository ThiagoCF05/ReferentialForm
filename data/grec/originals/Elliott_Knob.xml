A small, naturally growing stand of spruce trees are on the summit, indicating that the altitude is just high enough to support tree species normally found hundreds of miles to the north.

 from the east but it is also closed to public vehicles. The jeep trail is used by the USFS to gain access to a fire lookout on the summit, and rises over 2,000 feet (610 m) in less than 4 miles (6.4 km). The only access for the public is on foot and along with the jeep trail, several other trails can be used to ascend to the top, each averaging 5 miles (8 km) in length and climbing up to 2,300 feet (700 m) from the trailheads. A small grassy cove is on the top and there is a spring 200 yards (200 m) below the summit which flows year round as well as a small man made pond not far from the spring.

Right beside the base of the fire tower there is a National Geodetic Survey triangulation station disk. The entire firetower structure is enclosed within a fence with barbed wire at the top. However there is evidence of people gaining entry in the form of holes under the fence and loose sections where the fence can be pulled up high enough for a person to crawl under, since the ground is only covered with grass in that area of the summit.</PARAGRAPH>
