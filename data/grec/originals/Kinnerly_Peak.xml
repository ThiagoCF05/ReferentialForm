 huge north face, which rises steeply from Upper Kintla Lake. From the lake to the summit is an elevation gain of 5,573 ft (1,699 m) in approximately 1 horizontal mile (5,280 ft/1.6 km). (This elevation gain over one horizontal mile is almost unmatched in the contiguous United States.)

 was made by a Sierra Club party led by the noted mountaineer Norman Clyde, in 1937. The standard climbing route ascends the northwest face, starting from the south shore of Upper Kintla Lake. It involves a large amount of elevation gain, mostly by scrambling, but with some exposed and mildly technical sections (Class 4 or easy Class 5). Other routes exist on the southeast and southwest faces. (Edwards 1995:84-89)</PARAGRAPH>
