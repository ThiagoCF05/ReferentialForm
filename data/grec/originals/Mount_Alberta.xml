The first ascent was made by members of the Japanese Alpine Club: S. Hashimoto, H. Hatano, T. Hayakawa, Y. Maki, Y.Mita, N. Okabe. The team was guided by Hans Fuhrer, H. Kohler and J. Weber. After some difficulty in dealing with an overhang and a steep series of ledges, they reached the top and ceremoniously planted an ice axe. The ice axe was left as a symbol of their achievement. Parties on subsequent ascents took parts of the axe to the American Alpine Club in New York and back home to Japan.
