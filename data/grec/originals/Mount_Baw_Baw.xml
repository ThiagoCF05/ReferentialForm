 consists of a long plateau tending north-east, with low peaks named Mount Whitelaw, Mount St. Phillack (the highest), Mount Mueller, Mount Tyers, Mount Kernot and Mount Saint Gwinear. The plateau itself is isolated from most of Victoria's high country by the Thomson and Aberfeldy Rivers and tributaries of the La Trobe River, including the Tanjil and Tyers Rivers to the south.

The Baw Baw massif consists of a late Devonian granodiorite pluton. There is relatively little relief on the plateau itself, the highest point (Mount St. Phillack) reaching 1567 metres. The lower slopes of the plateau are covered in montane eucalypt forest and tall forest, and creek valleys have cool temperate rainforest of myrtle beech, Nothofagus cunninghamii. Above 1200 metres snow gum woodland occur, grading into subalpine grasslands and shrublands above 1300 metres. Much of this subalpine zone is included in the 133 sq km Baw Baw National Park. The Baw Baw Village ski resort is technically outside the National Park.

The climate of the plateau itself is subalpine, with average annual precipitation of 1900 mm per annum. Snow covers the plateau from June to September.
