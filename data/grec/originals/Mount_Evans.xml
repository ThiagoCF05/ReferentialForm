From the entrance station on Colorado 5 ($10/car, $3/bike), one can get to the summit by driving the byway or by hiking the trail which runs along nearby. Along the route are several scenic sites and overlooks, including - Echo Lake, the upper Goliath trailhead and scenic overlook, Summit Lake including the Chicago Lakes scenic overlook, and Lincoln Lake - and other nearby peaks - Goliath Peak, Roger Peak, and Mount Warren. From the parking lot at the road's end (14,130 feet / 4,307 m) a short trail leads to the summit. There are also several other trails inside the Mount Evans Wilderness Area, which are accessible from several points along the Byway.

Near the summit stands the University of Denver's Meyer-Womble Observatory. At 14,148 feet (4,312 m) it is the second highest telescope in the world. The ruins of the Crest House (1941-1942) sit nearby. Once containing both a restaurant and a gift shop, it burned down on September 1, 1979 and was not rebuilt, but remains as a place of contemplation today. The rock foundation and walls remain as a windbreak for mountain travelers, and the viewing platform is one of Colorado's premier scenic overlooks.</PARAGRAPH>
