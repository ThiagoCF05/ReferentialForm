 is now rather easy, since a road off the historic and scenic Blue Ridge Parkway runs nearby, and a trail leads through a conifer forest to the top. The summit once featured a 40 ft (12 m) stone observation tower, which was torn down in late 2006 and is being replaced by a shorter observation platform. Also at the summit is the tomb of Dr. Mitchell.

The high elevations also expose plant life to high levels of pollution, including acid precipitation – rain, snow, and fog with very low pH. These acids damage the spruce and fir trees particularly badly, in part by releasing natural metals from the soil like aluminum, and by leaching important minerals. This stress also reduces the trees' resistance and immunity to insects, especially to non-native introduced pests like the Balsam woolly adelgid (see aphid).

Repairing the damage is a difficult issue, as the pollutants are often carried in from long distances. Sources can be local or hundreds of miles or kilometers away, requiring cooperation from as far away as the Midwest.
