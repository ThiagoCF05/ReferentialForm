Views from the summit include much of the northern section of Yellowstone National Park and on clear days, the Teton Range is also visible. The mountain trails are some of the most frequented in the park, so summer hikes can be crowded. With an altitude gain of 1,393 feet (424 m) in 3 miles (4.8 km), the hike from Dunraven Pass to the summit is moderate. Another trail which climbs 1,491 feet (454 m) in only 2.25 miles (3.6 km) starts from the Chittenden parking area.
