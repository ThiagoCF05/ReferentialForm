 is located in Grand Teton National Park in the U.S. state of Wyoming. The next closest higher summit is more than 10 miles (16 km) distant, and this isolation provides sweeping views of the Teton Range, much of the northern Jackson Hole area as well as the Snake River. Though located adjacent to the Tetons,

 has a 5 mile (8 km) long road providing vehicular access to an observation area located just below the main summit. There is also a 3 mile hiking trail (one way) to the summit from Signal Mountain Lodge and campground. The trail splits in the middle for a portion of approximately 1.5 miles, allowing hikers to take either a trail along the lower part of the ridge or south of the ridge past a series of small ponds. The trails then rejoin and steepen over the last mile to reach the secondary summit of

, the Jackson Lake Overlook. The trail rises approximately 800 feet from the campground to the overlook, though on the ridge trail there is quite a bit of up and down that adds a few hundred feet to the cumulative elevation gain.

It is important to note that the trail is a hiking only trail, mountain biking and horseback riding is not permitted by the park service. The road is a popular biking destination due to the difficult climb up and then (after turning around at the summit) continuous downhill experienced on a 3.5 mile portion of the road.</PARAGRAPH>
