Located .48 miles (.77 km) southeast of Buck Mountain, the summit is also east of the Alaska Basin Trail, from a point known as Static Peak Divide, the summit can be climbed in a scramble. Below the summit on the north face, a small remnant glacier persists, sheltered from direct sunlight by steep cliffs.</PARAGRAPH>
