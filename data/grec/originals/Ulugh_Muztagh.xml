The 7,723 metre elevation claim was made by the English country gentleman and explorer Saint George Littledale in 1895. Despite the fact that earlier explorers had put forward elevations several hundred metres lower, and the scientific 6,973 metre measurement made in 1985, the Littledale elevation has been so resilient that even into the 21st century it still remains the most widely quoted; it is found in generally reliable publications including the Times Atlas, Encyclopedia Britannica, and fact books.

Other remote Tibetan mountains whose elevations have been established by SRTM and modern Chinese mapping include:
* Nganglong (Aling) Kangri, 32°48'30N,81°00'03E, 6,720 m, but still often quoted at 7,315 m 
* Amne Machin (Maqen Gangri), 34°47'54N,99°27'45E, 6,282 m, but still often quoted at 7,160 m
* Buka Daban Feng, 36°01'27N,90°51'57E, 6,860 m, but still quoted much higher
* Zangser Kangri, 34°23'39N,85°51'00E, 6,540 m, but still sometimes quoted at 6,940 m.</PARAGRAPH>
