		<STRING> is a popular tourist destination. There are two mountain huts and a campsite at Dreki, by Drekagil, which is about 100km by unpaved road from the Icelandic ring-road. A dirt road climbs 8km up from Dreki into the Askja caldera. It is a walk of about 2.5km from the car park to Öskjuvatn and Víti. The roads are usually only open for about two or three months in high summer.</STRING>
