		<STRING> is still called by names cognate with &quot;Abyssinia,&quot; e.g. Turkish Habesistan and Arabic Al Habesh, meaning land of the Habesha people. The English name &quot;Ethiopia&quot; is thought to be derived from the Greek word Αἰθιοπία Aithiopia, from Αἰθίοψ Aithiops ‘an Ethiopian’, derived from Greek terms meaning &quot;of burnt (αιθ-) visage (ὄψ)&quot;. However, this etymology is disputed, since the Book of Aksum, a Ge'ez chronicle first composed in the 15th century, states that the name is derived from &quot;'Ityopp'is&quot;, a son (unmentioned in the Bible) of Cush, son of Ham who according to legend founded the city of Axum.</STRING>
