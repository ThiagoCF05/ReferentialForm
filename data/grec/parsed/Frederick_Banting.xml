		<STRING> idea, which was not physiologically sound in any case. However, the results encouraged further intensive work in the fall, with direct participation by Macleod and the chemist James Collip. The use of dog pancreases proved impractical and was soon abandoned in favour of using pancreas from calves and cows. The technique of tying pancreatic ducts was also discarded, with all the efforts concentrated on developing methods to extract a useful extract from a normal pancreas. The efforts of the team in 1921-1922 culminated in developing the ability to obtain a useful extract, named insulin.</STRING>

		<STRING>This was one of the most significant advances in medicine at the time. Insulin was not only discovered, but put into mass production in a matter of months. Hence, almost immediately it began to extend the lives of millions of people worldwide who suffered from the endocrine disease diabetes mellitus that could not be treated and had a very poor prognosis. People suffered from problems with fat and protein metabolism, leading to blindness and then death only a short time after the onset of the illness. Leonard Thompson was the first person to be administered.</STRING>
