Today it is generally considered an easy climb, except for the last 60 metres to the top. Climbs normally start from either the Rifugio Chabod or the Rifugio Vittorio Emanuele. The latter is named after Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy who created the Gran Paradiso royal reserve in 1856, presently Gran Paradiso National Park.</STRING>
