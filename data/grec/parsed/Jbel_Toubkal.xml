		<STRING> from the road-end village of Imlil. Qualified local guides can be hired, as well as mules and porters, to carry equipment and food supplies higher into the mountains. For experienced mountaineers guides are not required for the normal route, as it is an easy hike and orientation is not a problem. Usage of the mules is questionable, as they are often being overloaded and mistreated, and there is no need to carry food or tents if you stay in the refuge.</STRING>

		<STRING>The normal route starts with easy walk to the village of Aroumd. Past Aroumd a floodplain is crossed and route follows the left slope of the valley southwards. Valley bends to the east to the tiny settlement of Sidi Chamharouch, which has grown around a Muslim shrine. At Sidi Chamharouch path leads over the stream and steeply uphill to the right side of the Isougouane valley which leads to two stone-built refuges (old Neltner Refuge and new Refuge du Toubkal) that are often used as base camp at 3,207m. It is possible to buy good meals in the Refuge du Toubkal. Tent can be pitched near the refuges for a small charge.</STRING>

		<STRING>In summer the mountains can be very dry, but are sometimes subjected to storms. Although the temperature should keep above zero during the day, freezing conditions are possible over 3,500m. In winter the mountains are covered in snow and ice, and can be prone to avalanches. Skiing is possible as the snow can lie to considerable depth and cover many rocky slopes. Information about state of the route can be obtained at Marrakech tourist offices or at Imlil.</STRING>
