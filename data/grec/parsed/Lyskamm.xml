		<STRING> consists of a five-kilometre-long ridge with two distinct peaks. The southern (Italian) face is somewhat rugged, and rises only a few hundred metres above the glacier below (Ghiacciaio del Lis), while the northern (Swiss) side is an impressive 1100-metre ice-covered wall, rising up from the Gorner Glacier.</STRING>

		<STRING> is often climbed as a traverse from the Felikjoch (West), to the Listjoch (East) or vice versa. The traverse consists mostly of a narrow, snow-covered ridge, with some scrambling over rocks. In good conditions, this route is fairly easy and objectively safe, however in bad snow conditions and/or bad visibility, the ridge can be challenging because of large, sometimes double, cornices, mainly on the southern side of the ridge.</STRING>

	<PARAGRAPH ID="3">
		<STRING>The eastern and highest of the two peaks is 4,527 m high, and was first ascended in 1861 by a 14-man team (eight Englishmen and six Swiss guides) led by J. F. Hardy and including William Edward Hall, up the east ridge. The ridge as a whole was first traversed three years later by Leslie Stephen, Edward Buxton, Jakob Anderegg and Franz Biener.</STRING>
