		<STRING> is the highest mountain on the island. At the summit the whole of Corfu can be seen, as well as Albania which lies a short distance from the island. On particularly clear days it is also possible to see Italy despite it being around 130km (80 miles) away. To reach the peak there is a narrow road with a number of hairpin bends, at the top there is a café for tourists, a telecommunications station, whose largest tower stands directly over a well , and a monastery. The first monastery on the site was Angevin, built in 1347 but then destroyed sometime around 1537. The current church on the site dates from around 1689, and the current facade was built during the 19th century. It is dedicated to the transfiguration of Christ.</STRING>
