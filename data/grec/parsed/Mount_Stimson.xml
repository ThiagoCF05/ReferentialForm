		<STRING> was in 1951, by J. Gordon Edwards and Alice Edwards; however they found clear evidence of a previous ascent. The standard route of ascent is the West (or Northwest) Face Route, starting from Nyack Creek. (A backpacking trail runs along Nyack Creek, providing access; however the Park Service warns that this is a more brushy and isolated trail than in other areas of the park, with numerous unbridged stream crossings. As in the rest of the park, grizzly bears are an issue as well.) The climbing route begins with &quot;tiresome uphill bushwhacking...for possibly three hours&quot; leading to alternating slopes and cliffs (Grades 3 and 4).
