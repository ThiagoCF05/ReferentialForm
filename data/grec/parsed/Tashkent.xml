		<STRING> came to be known as Chachkand/Chashkand, meaning &quot;Chach City.&quot; (Kand, qand, kent, kad, kath, kud--all meaning a city, are derived from the Old Iranian, kanda, meaning a town or a city. They are found in city names like Samarkand, Yarkand, Penjikent etc.) After the 16th century and the steady replacement of the old, Persian-speaking population with Uzbeks, the name was changed slightly from Chachkand/Chashkand to Tashkand, which as &quot;stone city&quot; was more meaningful to the new inhabitants than the old name. The modern spelling of Tashkent is a Soviet product.</STRING>
