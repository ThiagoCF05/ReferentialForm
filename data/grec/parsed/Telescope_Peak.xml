		<STRING> summit rises 11,331 feet (3,478 m) above the floor of Death Valley (Badwater, -282 ft/-86 m) in about 15 miles (24 km), and about 10,000 feet (3,050 m) above the floor of Panamint Valley in about 8 miles (13 km). This is comparable to the rises for other large US peaks such as Mount Rainier, Mount Shasta, and Mount San Jacinto. (It is even somewhat comparable to the rise of Mount Everest above its northern base on the Tibetan Plateau, a rise of roughly 13,000 ft (4,000 m). However Everest rises much more, and much more steeply, above its southern base in Nepal.)</STRING>
