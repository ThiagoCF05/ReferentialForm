		<STRING> overtops the illustrious Matterhorn by some 60 m. Departing from the Tracuit at 3265 m, you'll reach the summit via the NW ridge. The first 3 hours consist of relatively easy walking across the glacier and will lead you on top of the Bishorn (4153 m). The second part of the ascent is more exposed and will take another 5 hrs. The ascent is not a piece of cake, but it's worth the effort.</STRING>
