		<STRING>One weekend each year the White Mountain Research Station opens the locked gate at 11,680 feet (3,560 m)that leads to Barcroft Station. The normal round trip hike from the gate is about 14 miles (23 km) round trip with less than 3,000 feet (900 m) of vertical gain. The open gate shaves about 4 miles (6 km) and 500 ft (150 m) of gain off the round trip. This route is often ridden with mountain bikes and has even been negotiated on a unicycle.</STRING>
