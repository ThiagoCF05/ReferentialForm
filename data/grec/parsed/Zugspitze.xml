This path goes through the Partnachklamm, a scenic gorge, then through the Reintal up to the Zugspitzplatt, a barren plateau. from there up to the summit.

It then crosses the Höllentalferner, the remnants of a small glacier. After that it traverses a wall with the help of iron ladders and steps. Via ferrata equipment is recommended for that part.

An easier path leads via the Ehrwalder Alm, across a small pass called &quot;Gatterl&quot;, joining the Reintal path at the Knorrhütte.</STRING>

		<STRING> exact height was a matter of debate for quite a while. Given figures ranged from 2 960 m to 2 970 m, but it is now generally accepted that the peak is 2 962 m above sea level as a result of a survey carried out by the Bavarian land survey office. The lounge at the new café is named &quot;2962&quot; for this reason.</STRING>
