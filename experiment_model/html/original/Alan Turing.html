     Alan Mathison Turing
    </span>
    , OBE (June 23, 1912 - June 7, 1954), was an English mathematician, logician, and cryptographer.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Turing

    is often considered to be the father of modern computer science.

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Turing
    </span>
    provided an influential formalisation of the concept of the algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, formulating the now widely accepted "Turing" version of the Church&ndash;Turing thesis, namely that any practical computing model has either the equivalent or a subset of the capabilities of a Turing machine.
    With the Turing test,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    made a significant and characteristically provocative contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence: whether it will ever be possible to say that a machine is conscious and can think.
    During World War II,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Turing
    </span>
    worked at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre, and

    </span>
    was for a time head of Hut 8, the section responsible for German Naval cryptanalysis.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including the method of the bombe, an electromechanical machine which could find settings for the Enigma machine.

   <p class="lead">
    After the war,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    worked at the National Physical Laboratory, creating one of the first designs for a stored-program computer, although it was never actually built.
    In 1947
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    moved to the University of Manchester to work, largely on software, on the Manchester Mark I then emerging as one of the world's earliest true computers.

    In 1952,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    was convicted of "acts of gross indecency" after admitting to a sexual relationship with a man in Manchester.

    was placed on probation and required to undergo hormone therapy.
