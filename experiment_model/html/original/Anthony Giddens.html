     Anthony Giddens
    </span>
    , Baron Giddens (born January 18, 1938) is a British sociologist
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     who
    </span>
    is renowned for
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    theory of structuration and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    holistic view of modern societies.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    is considered to be one of the most prominent modern contributors in the field of sociology, the author of at least 34 books, published in at least 29 languages, issuing on average more than one book every year.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    has been described as Britain's best known social scientist since John Maynard Keynes.

   <p class="lead">
    Three notable stages can be identified in
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    academic life.
    The first one involved outlining a new vision of what sociology is, presenting a theoretical and methodological understanding of that field, based on a critical reinterpretation of the classics.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    major publications of that era include Capitalism and Modern Social Theory (1971) and New Rules of Sociological Method (1976).
    In the second stage
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Giddens
    </span>
    developed the theory of structuration, an analysis of agency and structure, in which primacy is granted to neither.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    works of that period, like Central Problems in Social Theory (1979) and The Constitution of Society (1984) brought
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    international fame on the sociological arena.
    The most recent stage concerns modernity, globalization and politics, especially the impact of modernity on social and personal life.
    This stage is reflected by
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    critique of postmodernity, and discussions of a new "utopian-realist" third way in politics, visible in the Consequence of Modernity (1990), Modernity and Self-Identity (1991), The Transformation of Intimacy (1992), Beyond Left and Right (1994) and The Third Way: The Renewal of Social Democracy (1998).
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Giddens'
    </span>
    ambition is both to recast social theory and to re-examine our understanding of the development and trajectory of modernity.
    It is not clear, however, that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    theories have had any beneficial impact on social research.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    theories have been criticised as being empty conceptual schemes lacking any empirical implications.
