     Aristotle
    </span>
    (Greek: Ἀ&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&tau;έ&lambda;&eta;&sigmaf; Aristot&eacute;lēs) (384 BC &ndash; March 7, 322 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher, a student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    wrote on diverse subjects, including physics, poetry, biology and zoology, logic, rhetoric, politics and government, and ethics.
    Along with Socrates and Plato,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Aristotle
    </span>
    was one of the most influential of ancient Greek philosophers.
    They transformed Presocratic Greek philosophy into the foundations of Western philosophy as we know it.
    Some consider Plato and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Aristotle
    </span>
    to have founded two of the most important schools of Ancient philosophy; others consider Aristotelianism as a development and concretization of Plato's insights.

    Although
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Aristotle
    </span>
    wrote dialogues, only fragments of these have survived.
    The works that have survived are in treatise form and were, for the most part, unpublished texts.
    These are generally thought to be lecture notes or texts used by

     his
    </span>
    students.
    Among the most important are Physics, Metaphysics (or Ontology), Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, De Anima (On the Soul) and Poetics.
    These works, although connected in many fundamental ways, differ significantly in both style and substance.
