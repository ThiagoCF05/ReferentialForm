    , or formally, the Republic of Colombia (Spanish: Rep&uacute;blica de Colombia, IPA [IPA: [re'pu&beta;̞lika &eth;̞e ko'lombja]]), is the northwesternmost country of South America.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Colombia
    </span>
    is bordered to the east by Venezuela and Brazil, to the south by Ecuador and Peru, to the North by the Atlantic Ocean, through the Caribbean Sea, and to the west by Panama and the Pacific Ocean.

    is a large and physically diverse nation.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     It
    </span>
    is the fourth-largest country in South America (after Brazil, Argentina, and Peru), with an area seven times greater than that of New England and more than twice that of France.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Its
    </span>
    vast territory is one of great physical contrasts, ranging from the towering, snowcapped peaks of the Andes to the hot, humid plains of the Amazon River Basin.
    Not only is
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Colombia
    </span>
    large in area, but
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it

    also has a large population, containing more people than any other South American country except Brazil.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     The nation's
    </span>
    population is not evenly distributed.
    Most of the people live in the mountainous western third of

    , where Bogot&aacute;, the capital, and most of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    other large cities are located.
    Because this western region has a pleasant climate and rich soil, it is also where most agricultural activity takes place.

    currently suffers from a low intensity armed conflict involving rebel guerrilla groups, paramilitary militias, and drug trafficking, that started to develop since approximately 1964 or 1966, which was when the FARC and later the ELN were founded and subsequently started their guerrilla insurgency campaigns against successive Colombian government administrations.
