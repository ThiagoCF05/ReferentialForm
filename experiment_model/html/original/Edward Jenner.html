     Edward Jenner
    </span>
    , FRS, (May 17, 1749 - January 26, 1823) was an English country doctor
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     who
    </span>
    studied nature and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    natural surroundings from childhood and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    practiced medicine in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, England.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He

    is famous as the first doctor to introduce and study the smallpox vaccine.

    trained in Sodbury, Gloucestershire as an apprentice to Dr. Ludlow for 8 years from the age of 13, then

    went up to London in 1770 to study under the surgeon John Hunter (a noted experimentalist, and later a fellow of the Royal Society) and others at St George's Hospital.
    William Osler records that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Jenner
    </span>
    was a student to
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     whom
    </span>
    Hunter repeated William Harvey's advice, very famous in medical circles, "Don't think, try".
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Jenner
    </span>
    therefore was early noticed by men famous for advancing the practice and institutions of medicine, and Hunter remained in correspondence with
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    over natural history and proposed
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    for the Royal Society.
    Returning to

    native countryside, by 1773
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    and others formed a medical society in Rodborough, Gloucestershire, meeting to read papers on medical subjects and dine together.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Jenner
    </span>
    contributed papers on angina pectoris, ophthalmia and valvular disease of the heart and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    </span>
    commented on cowpox.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    also belonged to a similar society which met in Alveston, near Bristol.

   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1788, following a careful study combining observation, experiment and dissection into a description of the previously misunderstood life of the cuckoo in the nest.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    description of the newly-hatched cuckoo pushing its host's eggs and fledglings from the nest (contrary to the existing belief that the adult cuckoo did it) was only confirmed in the 20th century when photography became feasible.
    Having observed the behaviour,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    demonstrated an anatomical adaptation for it--the baby cuckoo has a depression in its back which is not present after 12 days of life, in which it cups eggs and other chicks to push them out of the nest.
    It had been assumed that the adult bird did this, but the adult does not remain in the area for sufficiently long.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    findings were published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1787.
    Some discrepancies in the paper are ascribed to
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    nephew who is said to have made up some observations.

    married Catherine Kingscote (died 1815 from tuberculosis) in March 1788 having met her when balloons were hot science, and
