     John Eric Bartholomew

    OBE (May 14, 1926 - May 28, 1984), better known by
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    stage name, Eric Morecambe was a British comedian
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     who
    </span>
    together with Ernie Wise, formed the double act Morecambe and Wise.
    In the United Kingdom
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    is widely considered a comic genius.

   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    Of all the comedy acts produced by the United Kingdom, Morecambe and Wise are arguably the best loved and most fondly remembered.
    They were perhaps the first truly great double act in the United Kingdom.
    Many have highlighted the genuine affection
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Eric
    </span>
    and Ernie had for one other.
    Their enjoyment of their work was picked up by the audience who regarded them as friends as well as entertainers.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    and Wise were well-regarded and their reputation enabled them to garner a number of prestigious guests including Angela Rippon, Princess Anne, Cliff Richard, Glenda Jackson, Tom Jones, Elton John and even former Prime Minister Harold Wilson.

    Des O'Connor was frequently the butt of their humour, such as his allegedly awful singing.
    O'Connor once asked
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Morecambe
    </span>
    if he could sing on their show.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Morecambe
    </span>
    replied "Sing on our show?
    You can't even sing on your own show!".
    When
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Morecambe
    </span>
    had
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    first heart attack in 1968,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    learned that O'Connor had told his audience to send their best wishes to
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Morecambe
    </span>
    ,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     who
    </span>
    replied "Tell him that those 12 people made all the difference".
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    In reality, O'Connor was very close friends of both
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Morecambe
    </span>
    and Wise and in later years would meet them to devise jokes about himself!
