     James Parkinson

    (April 11, 1755 - December 21, 1824) was an English physician, geologist, paleontologist, and political activist.

   <p class="lead">

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    </span>
    1817 work, Palsy, in which
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    was the first to describe paralysis agitans, a condition that would later acquire
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his

    namesake known as Parkinson's Disease.

     James Parkinson
    </span>
    was born in Shoreditch, London, England.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    was the son of John Parkinson, an apothecary and surgeon practicing in Hoxton Square in London.
    In 1784
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     James Parkinson

    was approved by the Corporation of London as a surgeon.

    On May 21, 1783,

     he

    married Mary Dale, with whom
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    subsequently had six children.
    Soon after
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    got married,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    succeeded
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    father in his practice in Hoxton Square.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He

    believed that any worthwhile physician should know shorthand, at which
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    was adept.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    In addition to
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    flourishing medical practice,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Parkinson

    had an avid interest in geology and paleontology, as well as the politics of the day.

   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Parkinson

    was a strong advocate for the under-privileged, and an outspoken critic of the Pitt-government.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    early career was marred by
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his

    being involved in a variety of social and revolutionary causes, and some historians think it most likely that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    was a strong proponent for the French Revolution.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    published nearly twenty political pamphlets in the post-French Revolution period, whilst Britain was in political chaos.
    Writing under

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    pseudonym "Old Hubert",
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he

    called for radical social reforms.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Parkinson

    called for representation of the people in the House of Commons, the institution of annual parliaments, and universal suffrage.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    was a member of several secret political societies, including the London Corresponding Society for Reform of Parliamentary Representation.
    In 1794
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    membership in the organization led to
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    being examined under oath before the Privy Council to give evidence about a plot to assassinate King George III.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    refused to testify regarding
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    part in "The Pop-Gun Plot", until
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    was certain
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    would not be forced to incriminate
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     himself
    </span>
    .
    The plan was to use a poisoned dart fired from a "pop gun" to bring the king's reign to a premature conclusion.
    Fortunately for
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Parkinson
    </span>
    , the whole affair was soon forgotten, and no charges were ever brought against
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    .
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Parkinson
    </span>
    turned away from
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    tumultuous political career, and between 1799 and 1807
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    published a number of medical works, including a work on gout in 1805.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    was also responsible for the earliest writings on the subject of peritonitis in English medical literature.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Parkinson
    </span>
    was also interested in improving the general health and well-being of the population.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    wrote several medical doctrines that exposed a similar zeal for the health and welfare of the people that was expressed by
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    political activism.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    was a crusader for legal protection for the mentally ill, as well as their doctors and families.

   <p class="lead">
    In 1812
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Parkinson
    </span>
    assisted
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    son with the first described case of appendicitis in English, and the first instance in which perforation was shown to be the cause of death.

    interest gradually turned from medicine to nature, specifically the relatively new field of geology, and paleontology.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    began collecting specimens and drawings of fossils in the latter part of the eighteenth century.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    took
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    children and friends on excursions to collect or observe fossil plants and animals.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    attempts to learn more about fossil identification and interpretation were frustrated by a lack of available literature, and so
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    took the decision to improve matters by writing
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    own introduction to the study of fossils.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    In 1804 the first volume of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    Organic Remains of the Former World was published.
    Gideon Mantell praised it as "the first attempt to give a familiar and scientific account [of fossils]".
    A second volume was published in 1808, and a third in 1811.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Parkinson
    </span>
    illustrated each volume, sometimes in color.
    The plates were later re-used by Gideon Mantell.
    In 1822
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    published the shorter "Elements of Oryctology: an Introduction to the Study of Fossil Organic Remains, especially of those found in British Strata".

     Parkinson
    </span>
    belonged to a school of thought, Catastrophism, that concerned itself with the belief that the Earth's geology and biosphere were shaped by recent large-scale cataclysms.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    cited the Noachian deluge of Genesis as an example, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    firmly believed that creation and extinction were processes guided by the hand of God.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    view on Creation was that each 'day' was actually a much longer period, that lasted perhaps tens of thousands of years in length.

    On November 13, 1807,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Parkinson
    </span>
    and a number of other distinguished gentlemen met at the Freemasons' Tavern.
    The gathering included such great names as Sir Humphry Davy, Arthur Aikin, and George Bellas Greenough.
    This was to be the first meeting of the Geological Society of London.
