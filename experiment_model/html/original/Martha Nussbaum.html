     Martha Nussbaum
    </span>
    (born Martha Craven on May 6, 1947) is an American philosopher, with a particular interest in ancient philosophy, political philosophy and ethics.

    studied theatre and classics at New York University (NYU) (BA 1969), gradually moving to philosophy while at Harvard (MA 1972; PhD 1975, under G. E. L. Owen).
    This period also saw

    During the 1980s

     Nussbaum
    </span>
    began a collaboration with economist Amartya Sen on issues of development and ethics.
    With Sen,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     she
    </span>
    promoted the "capability approach" to development, which views capabilities ("substantial freedoms", such as the ability to live to old age, engage in economic transactions, or participate in political activities) as the constitutive parts of development, and poverty as capability-deprivation.
    This contrasts with a common view that sees development purely in terms of economic growth, and poverty purely as income-deprivation.
    It is also universalist, and therefore contrasts with relativist approaches to development.
    Much of the work is presented from an Aristotelian perspective.

    has used the capability approach to reinterpret John Rawls' Theory of Justice.
    For
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    </span>
    , Rawls's Liberty Principle is only meaningful if viewed in terms of substantial freedoms, i.e.
    real opportunities based on personal and social circumstance.
    Likewise, inequality in the Difference Principle has to be clarified in terms of capabilities.
