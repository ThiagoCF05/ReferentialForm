    is the highest peak in the Wrangell Mountains of Alaska in the United States.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

     The mountain's

    massif is covered almost entirely by icefields and glaciers, and is the principal source of ice for the Kennicott Glacier, which flows southeast over 20 mi to just above the town of McCarthy.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    also contributes a large volume of ice to the north-flowing Nabesna Glacier and the Kuskulana Glacier system.

     Mount Blackburn
    </span>
    is a large, dramatic peak, with great local relief and independence from higher peaks.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Its
    </span>
    west face drops over 11,000 ft (3,350 m) to the Kuskulana Glacier in less than 4 horizontal miles (6 km).
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Its
    </span>
    other faces drop 8,000-10,000 feet (2,440-3,050 m), all in less than 8 miles.
    The toe of the Kuskulana Glacier, less than 12 miles from the summit, lies at an elevation of 2,400 ft (730 m), giving a rise of 14,000 ft (4,270 m).
    While these figures speak to the peak's relief, one measure of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     its
    </span>
    independence is that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it

    is the 50th most topographically prominent peak in the world.

     the mountain&rsquo;s

    highpoint, a fact that was not understood until the 1960s when the then new USGS maps came out.
    The first ascent of the west peak, and hence
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mount Blackburn
    </span>
    , was done on May 30, 1958 by Bruce Gilbert, Dick Wahlstrom, Hans Gmoser, Adolf Bitterlich, and Leon Blumer via the North (also called the Northwest) Ridge.
    This team made the first ascent of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Blackburn
    </span>
    , but did not even know it at the time due to the incorrect identification of the highpoint.
    In fact Blumer&rsquo;s article in the 1959 American Alpine Journal is titled &ldquo;Mount Blackburn - Second Ascent.&rdquo;
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    Kennedy Peak, or East Blackburn, 16,286 ft (4964 m), is the eastern summit and the one that was originally thought to be the highest point.
    The first ascent of this summit was made in 1912 by Dora Keen and George Handy via the Kennicott Glacier (on the south side of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain
    </span>
    ) and East Face.
    This heady exploit was ahead of its time.
    Dora Keen, driven by a deep desire for the climb, solicited miners from the nearby Kennicott Copper Mine, and forged a route up the heavily crevassed East Face to the East Peak, but did not traverse over to the West Peak.
    Keen went on to write a famous article for the Saturday Evening Post titled, &ldquo;First up Mount Blackburn.&rdquo; In 1912, Keen and Handy thought they were on
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Blackburn&rsquo;s
    </span>
    highest point.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    Today's standard route on the peak is the 1958 ascent route, the North (or Northwest) Ridge, which is approached from the Nabesna Glacier, on the north side of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain
    </span>
    , opposite from Keen and Hardy's route.
    The route starts from an airstrip on the glacier at an altitude of 7,200 feet.
    It is a moderate climb by Alaskan standards (Alaska Grade 2).
