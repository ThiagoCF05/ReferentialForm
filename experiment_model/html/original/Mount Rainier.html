     Mount Rainier

    is an active stratovolcano in Pierce County, Washington, located southeast of Seattle, Washington, in the United States.

    is the highest peak in the Cascade Range and Cascade Volcanic Arc at 14,411 feet (4,392 m).

    and the surrounding area are protected within Mount Rainier National Park.
    With 26 major glaciers,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mount Rainier
    </span>
    is the most heavily glaciated peak in the lower 48 states with 35 square miles (91 km�) of permanent snowfields and glaciers.
    The summit is topped by two volcanic craters, each over 1,000 feet (300 m) in diameter with the larger east crater overlapping the west crater.
    Geothermal heat from
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the volcano
    </span>
    keeps areas of both crater rims free of snow and ice, and has formed an extensive network of glacier caves within the ice-filled craters.
    A small crater lake, the highest in North America, occupies the lowest portion of the west crater below more than 160 feet (50 m) of ice and is accessible only via the caves.

    can also be seen from as far away as Portland, Oregon, and Victoria, British Columbia.
    Because of

    .
    The sources of the White River are Winthrop, Emmons, and Fryingpan Glaciers.
    The White, Carbon, and Mowich join the Puyallup River, which discharges into Commencement Bay at Tacoma; the Nisqually empties into Puget Sound east of Lacey; and the Cowlitz joins the Columbia River between Kelso and Longview.
