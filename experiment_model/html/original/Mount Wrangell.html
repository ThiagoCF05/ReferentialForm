     Mount Wrangell
    </span>
    is a massive shield volcano located in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve in southeastern Alaska, United States.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     The shield

    rises over 12,000 ft (3700 m) above the Copper River to

    southwest.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Its
    </span>
    volume is over 220 mi&sup3; (900 km&sup3;), making
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    </span>
    more than twice as massive as Mount Shasta in California, the largest stratovolcano by volume in the Cascades.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    An ice-filled caldera 4 by 6 km in diameter lies at the top of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Wrangell's
    </span>
    broad shield.
    The caldera was apparently formed by subsidence rather than large explosive eruptions.
    The caldera is in turn rimmed by three small craters, which often display fumarolic activity with steam plumes that can sometimes be seen from a distance.
    The main summit is on the north side of the caldera, while the west summit rises to 14,013 feet (4,271 m).
    The summit region above 13,000 ft (4000 m) in elevation is over 2 x 5 miles (3 x 8 km) in size.
    A very large cinder cone, 13009 ft Mount Zanetti, rises nearly 1000 ft (300 m) above the northwest flank of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    and is the source of some lava flows.

   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    is unusual in that despite being a shield volcano,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    is made mainly of andesite rather than basalt, which forms most shield volcanoes in other parts of the world.
    A few other volcanoes in the Wrangell Volcanic Field also share this feature.
    Andesite is a volcanic rock found mainly in stratovolcanoes and tends to form short, stubby flows.
    How
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Wrangell
    </span>
    grew into a shield volcano is poorly understood, but
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     its
    </span>
    lava flows appear to have been voluminous and were also probably generated by high eruption rates.

   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Wrangell
    </span>
    is the only volcano in the Wrangell Volcanic Field to have had historically recorded eruptions, generally in the form of small steam and ash explosions.
    The amount of geothermal heat being emitted by
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Wrangell
    </span>
    has been increasing since the 1950s, raising the possibility of a future eruption.
    Also, the heat flux has been high enough to melt ice around the craters and create ice caves.
