    (or Volc&aacute;n de Par&iacute;cutin, commonly also accented Paricut&iacute;n or spelled unaccented as Paricutin) is a volcano in the Mexican state of Michoac&aacute;n, close to a lava-covered village of the same name.

    appears on many versions of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.

    began as a fissure in a cornfield owned by Tarascan farmer Dionisio Pulido on February 20, 1943.
    Pulido, his wife, and son, all witnessed the initial eruption of ash and stones first-hand as they plowed the field.
    Much of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the volcano's
    </span>
    growth occurred during
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     its
    </span>
    first year, while
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    was still in the explosive pyroclastic phase.
    Nearby villages Paricut&iacute;n (after which
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the volcano
    </span>
    was named) and San Juan Parangaricutiro were both buried in lava and ash; the residents relocated to vacant land nearby.

   <p class="lead">
    At the end of this phase after roughly one year
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the volcano
    </span>
    had grown 336 metres tall.
    For the next eight years
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the volcano
    </span>
    would continue erupting, although this was dominated by relatively quiet eruptions of lava that would scorch the surrounding 25 km&sup2; of land.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     The volcano's
    </span>
    activity would slowly decline during this period until the last six months of the eruption, during which violent and explosive activity was frequent.
    In 1952 the eruption ended and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Par&iacute;cutin
    </span>
    went quiet, attaining a final height of 424 metres above the cornfield from which
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    was born.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     The volcano
    </span>
    has been quiet since.
    Like most cinder cones,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Par&iacute;cutin
    </span>
    is a monogenetic volcano, which means that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    will never erupt again.

    Three people died as a result of lightning strikes caused by the eruptions, but no deaths were attributed to the lava or asphyxiation.
