    SOM (July 11, 1963-March 3, 2000) was a Canadian curler, an Olympic and triple World Champion.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    Born in Biggar, Saskatchewan,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Schmirler
    </span>
    learned curling at high school.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Her
    </span>
    first major successes in the sport came in 1991, when
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     she
    </span>
    won the provincial championships as the skip (captain) of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     her
    </span>
    team.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    Only two years later, in 1993,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Schmirler's
    </span>
    Regina-based team also won the Canadian Championships, and were sent out to the World Championships, which they won.
    At this time,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     her
    </span>
    name was Sandra Peterson from
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     her
    </span>
    first marriage; while
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     she
    </span>
    remarried,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     she
    </span>
    would revert to
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     her
    </span>
    maiden name.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Her

    rink repeated those performances in 1994 and 1997.

   <p class="lead">
    At the 1998 Winter Olympics,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Schmirler
    </span>
    sailed through the round-robin competition with relative ease, and in the semi-final
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    faced the all-Scottish Great Britain rink, which was skipped by Kirsty Hay but also included a future world championship-winning skip for Scotland, Jackie Lockhart.
    The game surprisingly went to an extra end, and a major upset appeared to be on the cards when
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Schmirler
    </span>
    shouted out "oh no!
    ", fearing
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     her
    </span>
    last stone was too heavy.
    However, it slowed up in the nick of time, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Schmirler's
    </span>
    team progressed to the final, where they faced the Danish rink skipped by Helena Blach Lavrsen, surprise conquerors of the formidable Swedish team.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Schmirler
    </span>
    spearheaded a deserved 7-5 victory, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    secured the gold medal for Canada.

   <p class="lead">
    The year after

     her
    </span>
    Olympic triumph,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Schmirler
    </span>
    was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, of which
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     she

    died on the morning of March 3, 2000, aged only 36.

   <p class="lead">
    In 2000,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     she
    </span>
    was awarded the Saskatchewan Order of Merit.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
