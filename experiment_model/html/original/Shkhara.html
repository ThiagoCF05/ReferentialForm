    is the highest point in the nation of Georgia.
    Located in the Svaneti region along the Russian frontier,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Shkhara

    lies north of the city of Kutaisi, Georgia's second largest city.
    The summit lies in the central part of the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range, to the south-east of Mount Elbrus, Europe's highest mountain.

    North Face (on the Russian side) is high and contains several classic difficult routes.
    The significant subsummit Shkhara West, 5068 m, is a climbing objective in its own right, and a traverse of the entire Bezingi Wall is considered "Europe's longest, most arduous, and most committing expedition."

     The peak
    </span>
    was first climbed in 1888 via the North East Ridge route, by the British/Swiss team of U. Almer, J. Cockin and C. Roth.
    This route is still one of the easier and more popular routes on
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain

    .
    The first complete traverse of the Bezingi Wall was in 1931, by the Austrians K. Poppinger, K. Moldan, and S. Schintlmeister.

   <p class="lead">
    Climbing on the Russian side of the massif is facilitated by the presence of the Bezengi Camp, a well-equipped base camp featuring huts, cottages, a library, and a sauna.
    The Georgian side is more remote, and persistent reports of banditry have kept climbers away.

    difficulty, size, and remoteness.
