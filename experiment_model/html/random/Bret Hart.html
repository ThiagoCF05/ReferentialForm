    (born July 2, 1957 in Calgary, Alberta) is a Canadian former professional wrestler, and part of the famous Hart wrestling family.
    In the course of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this Canadian former professional wrestler's
    </span>
    career,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this Canadian former professional wrestler
    </span>
    was known by several monikers: Bret "Hit Man" Hart, (adopted from boxer Thomas Hearns), "The Excellence of Execution" (originally dubbed as such by Gorilla Monsoon) and perhaps the most resounding, "The best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be" (derived from the 1984 film The Natural, which starred Robert Redford).

   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Hart
    </span>
    justifies
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this Canadian former professional wrestler's
    </span>
    claim to the latter title by citing three facts: that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Hart
    </span>
    never seriously injured an opponent through any fault of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Hart's
    </span>
    own; that, in the course of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Hart's
    </span>
    career with the World Wrestling Federation,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Hart
    </span>
    only ever missed two shows, both as a result of traffic and flight difficulties, and that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the Canadian former professional wrestler

    rarely refused to job.
