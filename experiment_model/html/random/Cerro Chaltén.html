    , also known as Cerro Fitz Roy or Monte Fitz Roy, is a mountain ('cerro') located near the El Chalt&eacute;n village, in the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, in Patagonia, on the border between Argentina and Chile.
    It has been agreed by the two countries that the international border detours eastwards to pass over the main summit, but a large part of the border to the south of the summit, as far as Cerro Murall&oacute;n remains undefined .

    The name Chalt&eacute;n comes from a Tehuelche (Aonikenk) word meaning "smoking mountain," due to a cloud that usually forms in the top of

    , and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    The alternate name 'Fitz Roy' comes from Robert FitzRoy who explored some of the area in 1834.

    is less than half the Himalayan giants), because the sheer granite faces present long stretches of arduous technical climbing.
    In addition, the weather in the area is exceptionally inclement and treacherous.

    The area, while still fairly inaccessible, was even more isolated until the recent development of El Chalten village and El Calafate International Airport.
    The mountain climb, however, remains extremely difficult and is the preserve of very experienced climbers.
