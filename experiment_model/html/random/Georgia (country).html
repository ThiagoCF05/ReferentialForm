    The English name Georgia is a transliteration of the Hellenistic term (Greek: &Gamma;&epsilon;&omega;&rho;&gamma;ί&alpha;) derived from Georgios (Greek: &Gamma;&epsilon;ώ&rho;&gamma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;), a Greek name meaning "farmer"; Georgia here is indicative of a farmland.
    Georgians used the Greek and Aramaic alphabets before adopting the Georgian alphabet, reformed by King Pharnavaz I of Iberia, which is not directly related to any other alphabet in the world.
    In 337, Christianity was declared the official state religion in the ancient Georgian Kingdom of Iberia, making

    </span>
    the second oldest country after Armenia (301) to declare Christianity
