     Glacier Peak

    (known in the Sauk Indian dialect of Lushootseed as "Tda-ko-buh-ba" or "Takobia" ) is the most remote of the five major volcanoes in the Cascade Volcanic Belt in Washington.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Glacier Peak

    is not prominently visible from any major population center, and so

    attractions, as well as
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    hazards, tend to be overlooked.
    Yet since the end of the last ice age,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this mountain
    </span>
    has produced some of the largest and most explosive eruptions in the state.
    During this time period,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    has erupted multiple times during at least six separate episodes, most recently about 200-300 years ago.

    The stunning snow-capped volcanoes of Washington have long been recognized by Native Americans in their language and legends, and they immediately caught the eyes of U.S. and European explorers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
    By the 1790s, Mounts Baker, Rainier, and St. Helens were noted and named in the first written descriptions of the Columbia River and Puget Sound regions.
    In 1805, Lewis and Clark noted Mount Adams.
    By the mid-19th century, each of these four volcanoes had their place on a published map.

   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This mountain
    </span>
    wasn't known by settlers to be a volcano until the 1850s, when Native Americans mentioned to naturalist George Gibbs that "another smaller peak to the north of Mount Rainier once smoked."
    Not until 1898 did
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    appear on a published map under
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    current name.

   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     The mountain
    </span>
    is situated in Snohomish County, only 70 miles (112 km) northeast of Seattle &mdash; closer to that city than any volcano except Mount Rainier.
    But unlike Mount Rainier,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain
    </span>
    rises only a few thousand feet above neighboring peaks, and from coastal communities
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it

    appears merely as a high point along a snowy saw-toothed skyline.
    Yet
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain
    </span>
    has been one of the most active of Washington's volcanoes.

   <p class="lead">
    Since the continental ice sheets receded from the region,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain
    </span>
    has erupted repeatedly during at least six episodes.
    Two of these eruptions were among the largest in Washington during the past 15,000 years.
