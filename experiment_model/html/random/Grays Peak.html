    is one of 54 fourteeners (mountains of over 14,000 feet (4,268 m) in elevation) in Colorado.

    The first man to ascend

    , botanist Charles C. Parry, named
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    for his botanist colleague Asa Gray.
    Gray actually did not see
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    until 1872, 11 years later.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     The mountain

    is nearly always mentioned in conjunction with nearby Torreys Peak.

     The mountain

    is located on the Continental Divide, as well as the boundary between Clear Creek County and Summit County.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    Usually a climb to the summit of

     the mountain

    is accompanied by continuing on to Torreys Peak, less than a mile away.

   <p class="lead">
    The main trail departs from Stevens Gulch, to the northeast.
    To get to the Stevens Gulch Trailhead, take I-70 west from Denver about 50 miles (80 km) to Bakerville.
    From there, take Stevens Gulch Road south about 2.5 miles (4 km) to the trailhead.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    From the trailhead, it is a hike of about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) and a climb of 3,040 feet (927 m).
    The trail, well-marked and well-trodden, begins by following the gulch for a slow rise in elevation, before hitting the steeper slopes.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    At the climber's option, the trail continues from the summit north to Torreys Peak.
    The trail descends the saddle down to 13,707 feet (4,178 m) before climbing back to the summit of Torreys Peak at 14,267 feet (4,349 m).
