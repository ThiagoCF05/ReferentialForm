     This mountain
    </span>
    ([Spanish: Volc&aacute;n Iraz&uacute;]) is an active volcano in Costa Rica, situated in the Cordillera Central close to the city of Cartago.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This mountain's
    </span>
    name is believed to be a corruption of Iztar&uacute;, which was the name of an indigenous village on the flanks of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    .
    In Costa Rica
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this mountain
    </span>
    is known by the name of "Colossus" due to the catastrophes that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this mountain
    </span>
    has provoked in the past.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     The mountain
    </span>
    has erupted frequently in historical times&mdash;at least 23 times since
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain's
    </span>
    first well-recorded eruption in 1723.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Its
    </span>
    most famous recent eruption began in 1963 and continued until 1965.
    It began on the day US President John F. Kennedy began a state visit to Costa Rica and showered the capital San Jos&eacute; and much of the central highlands of Costa Rica with ash.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    Since the 1963&ndash;65 eruption,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    has been dormant, although frequent earthquake swarms show that magma is still moving about beneath
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain
    </span>
    .
    In 1994, a small phreatic eruption occurred, caused by heavy rains destabilising part of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain's
    </span>
    flank, resulting in rapid decompression of a shallow hydrothermal system.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Its
    </span>
    summit has several craters, one of which contains Diego de la Haya, a green crater lake of variable depth.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     It
    </span>
    is the highest active volcano in Costa Rica.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     The mountain
    </span>
    is easily visited from San Jos&eacute;, with a road leading right up to the summit craters and a daily bus service to the top.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     The mountain
    </span>
    is thus a popular tourist spot.
    The volcano summit also spots a few television transmitters for television stations in San Jos&eacute;.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    From the top it is claimed to be possible to see both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans on a clear day; however, such clear days are very rare indeed, and it is typical for
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain's
    </span>
    summit to be covered in cloud for much of the time.
