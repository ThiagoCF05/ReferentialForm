     He
    </span>
    (October 22, 1844 - November 16, 1885), was a Canadian politician, a founder of the province of Manitoba, and leader of the M&eacute;tis people of the Canadian prairies.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    led two resistance movements against the Canadian government that sought to preserve M&eacute;tis rights and culture as their homelands in the Northwest Territories came progressively under the Canadian sphere of influence.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    The first such resistance was the Red River Rebellion of 1869-1870.
    The provisional government established by
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the Canadian politician
    </span>
    ultimately negotiated the terms under which the modern province of Manitoba entered the Canadian Confederation.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    was forced into exile in the United States as a result of the controversial execution of Thomas Scott during the rebellion.
    Despite this,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the Canadian politician
    </span>
    is frequently referred to as the "Father of Manitoba."
    While a fugitive,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Riel
    </span>
    was elected three times to the Canadian House of Commons, although
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    never assumed
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this Canadian politician's
    </span>
    seat.
    During these years,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Riel
    </span>
    suffered from bouts of mental illness, including the delusion that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Riel
    </span>
    was a divinely chosen leader and prophet.
    This conviction later resurfaced and influenced
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this Canadian politician's
    </span>
    later actions.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    married in 1881 while in exile in Montana, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    fathered three children.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    In 1884,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    returned to what is now the province of Saskatchewan to represent M&eacute;tis grievances to the Canadian government.
    This resistance escalated into a military confrontation known as the North-West Rebellion of 1885.
    It ended in
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the Canadian politician's
    </span>
    arrest, trial, and eventual execution on a charge of High Treason.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This Canadian politician
    </span>
    was viewed sympathetically in francophone regions of Canada, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the Canadian politician's
    </span>
    execution had a lasting influence on relations between the province of Quebec and English-speaking Canada.
    Whether seen as a Father of Confederation or a traitor,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the Canadian politician
    </span>
    remains one of the most complex, controversial, and ultimately tragic figures in the history of Canada.
