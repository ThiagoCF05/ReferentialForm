     The capital city
    </span>
    (Dhivehi: މާލެ), (pronounced: "Maa-lay") population 81,647 (2004), is the capital of the Republic of Maldives.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This capital city
    </span>
    is located on Mal&eacute; Island in the Kaafu Atoll.
    Although
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    is geographically located in Kaafu Atoll, administratively
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    is not considered part of it.
    A commercial harbor is located in the Island.
    It is the heart of all commercial activities in the country.
    Many government buildings and agencies are located on the waterfront.
    Mal&eacute; International Airport is on adjacent Hulhule Island which includes a seaplane base for internal transportation.
    Several land reclamation projects have expanded the harbour.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     It
    </span>
    is located at 4&deg;10' North, 73&deg;30' East (4.1667, 73.5).

    was founded by Portuguese traders in the 16th century.

   <p class="lead">
    The island is heavily urbanised,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the capital city
    </span>
    taking up essentially its entire landmass.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     It
    </span>
    is the world's most densely populated city (see list of selected cities by population density).
    Slightly less than one third of the nation's population lives in
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the capital city
    </span>
    .
    Many, if not most, Maldivians and foreign workers in Maldives find themselves in occasional short term residence on the island due to it being the only entry point to the nation and the center of all administration and bureaucracy.

     This capital city

    is divided into four divisions; Henveiru, Galolhu, Maafannu and Machangolhi.

     The capital city

    was struck by the tsunami that swept across the western coast of Sumatra on December 26 2004.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     It
    </span>
    was affected by the Indian Ocean earthquake which followed with the waves flooding two-thirds of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the capital city
    </span>
    .
    The earthquake and subsequent tsunamis reportedly killed over 220,000 people around the rim of the Indian Ocean.
