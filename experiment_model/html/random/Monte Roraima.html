    lies on the Guiana Shield in the southeastern corner of Venezuela's 30,000 km&sup2; Canaima National Park, which is roughly located in the Gran Sabana region.
    The tabletop mountains of the park are considered some of the oldest geological formations on Earth, dating back to the Precambrian Era, some two billion years ago.

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    is central to many of their myths and legends.
    The Pemon Indians of the Gran Sabana see
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Roraima
    </span>
    as the stump of a mighty tree that once held all the fruits and tuberous vegetables in the world.
    Felled by one of their ancestors, the tree crashed to the ground, unleashing a terrible flood.
    "Roroi" in the Pemon language means blue-green and "ma" means great.
