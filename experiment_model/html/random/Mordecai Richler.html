    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the onetime enfant terrible's
    </span>
    fourth novel The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz in 1959.
    The book featured a frequent Richler theme: Jewish life in the neighbourhood in and around St. Urbain Street and the Main, (St. Lawrence Street), east of Mount Royal Park, in 1930s and 40s Montreal.
    The 1974 movie version was directed by
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    </span>
    friend Ted Kotcheff and starred Richard Dreyfuss in his first leading role.

    later years,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    Another favorite Richler target was the government-subsidized Canadian literary movement of the 1970s and 80s.
    Late in life,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Richler
    </span>
    seemed happy to settle into the role of curmudgeon.
    What never changed were
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Richler's
    </span>
    caustic comments and disheveled appearance.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    was more than willing to say the unsayable -- though often in a weary mumble, with head bowed, hair askew and drink in hand.
    Admirers praised
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    for daring to tell uncomfortable truths.A 2004 oral biography by Michael Posner was entitled The Last Honest Man.

    frequently said in interviews that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    goal was to be an honest witness to
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this onetime enfant terrible's
    </span>
    time and place, and to write at least one book that would be read after
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Richler's
    </span>
    death.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    work was championed by journalists Robert Fulford and Peter Gzowski, among others.
    Detractors called

    </span>
    satire heavy-handed and noted
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    propensity for recycling material.
    Some critics thought
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this onetime enfant terrible
    </span>
    more adept at sketching striking scenes than crafting coherent narratives.

    ambivalent relationship with Montreal's Jewish community was captured in Mordecai and Me, a book by Joel Yanofsky published in 2003.

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his

    death.
    It was an ironic finale that might have made a memorable scene in a Richler novel: a fierce critic of the Canadian establishment accepting the country's highest honour.
