    is the highest mountain in Glacier National Park, located in Montana, United States.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     It

    is also the highest point in the Lewis Range, which spans part of the northern portion of the Park and extends into Canada.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This mountain

    is located approximately 3 mi (5 km) southeast of the southern end of Waterton Lake, and approximately 5 mi (8 km) south of the US/Canada border.

   <p class="lead">
    While not of great absolute elevation,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    is notable for
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    large, steep rise above local terrain.
    For example,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this mountain's
    </span>
    west flank rises over 5,500 ft (1,720 m) in less than 2 miles (3.2 km); the northwest face, steepest on
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this mountain
    </span>
    , rises 4,000 ft in less than 0.4 miles (2100 ft/0.64 km).
    The other faces show almost as much vertical relief.
    This scale and steepness of relief is quite rare in the contiguous United States.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mount Cleveland
    </span>
    is also 50th on the US with the most topographic prominence.

   <p class="lead">
    The first recorded ascent of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    was in 1924, by members of the Sierra Club.
    The easiest route on
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mount Cleveland
    </span>
    is the West Face route, starting from the Waterton Valley; it is a scramble (Class 3) with the possibility of some short exposed sections (Class 4).
    (Edwards, 1995) Given the nontechnical nature of the route, and the attested presence of Native Americans on other high summits in the area, this summit was probably attained much earlier than 1924.

    Other routes include the Stoney Indian Route, from Stoney Indian Pass to the south of the peak, first descended by noted Sierra mountaineer Norman Clyde and party in 1937; various routes on the Southeast Face; and the more difficult North (or Northwest) Face, climbed partially in 1971 and completely in 1976.
