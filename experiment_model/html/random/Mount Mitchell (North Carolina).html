     The mountain

    is the highest peak of the Appalachian Mountains and the highest peak in eastern North America, excluding island summits.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This mountain
    </span>
    was the highest point in any state of the United States until Texas joined the union in 1845.
    The nearest higher point on the North American continent is Harney Peak in the Black Hills of South Dakota.

    is located near Burnsville in Yancey County, North Carolina, in the Black Mountain subrange of the Appalachians, and about 32 kilometres (20 mi) northeast of Asheville.

    was named after Elisha Mitchell, a professor at the University of North Carolina, who determined
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    height in 1835 and fell to his death at nearby Mitchell Falls in 1857, having returned to verify his earlier measurements.

    The ascent of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mount Mitchell
    </span>
    is now rather easy, since a road off the historic and scenic Blue Ridge Parkway runs nearby, and a trail leads through a conifer forest to the top.
    The summit once featured a 40 ft (12 m) stone observation tower, which was torn down in late 2006 and is being replaced by a shorter observation platform.
    Also at the summit is the tomb of Dr. Mitchell.

    The weather on
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this mountain
    </span>
    is very mild in the summer and very harsh in the winter, more like Maine or southeastern Canada than the southeastern U.S.
    In 1985, the coldest temperature ever recorded in the state occurred there on January 21 when it fell to -34&deg;F (-37&deg;C), during a severe cold spell that brought freezing temperatures as far south as Miami.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mount Mitchell
    </span>
    is also the coldest average reporting station in the state at 43.8&deg;F or 6.6&deg;C which is well below any other station.
    The summit is often windy, with the record being 286 km/h or 178 MPH.

    The high elevations also expose plant life to high levels of pollution, including acid precipitation &ndash; rain, snow, and fog with very low pH.
    These acids damage the spruce and fir trees particularly badly, in part by releasing natural metals from the soil like aluminum, and by leaching important minerals.
    This stress also reduces the trees' resistance and immunity to insects, especially to non-native introduced pests like the Balsam woolly adelgid (see aphid).

   <p class="lead">
    While
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain
    </span>
    is still mostly lush and green in the summer, many dead trunks can be seen due to these serious problems.
    Repairing the damage is a difficult issue, as the pollutants are often carried in from long distances.
    Sources can be local or hundreds of miles or kilometers away, requiring cooperation from as far away as the Midwest.

   <p class="lead">
    Still, hundreds of tourists visit
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mount Mitchell
    </span>
    each spring through autumn, for
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     its
    </span>
    incredible views and sunsets.
    Wildflowers are abundant all summer long.
    Young fir and spruce trees do well in the subalpine climate, and their pine cones feed the birds along with wild blueberry and blackberry shrubs.
    For visitors, a snack bar more palatable for humans is also available at the summit parking lot.
