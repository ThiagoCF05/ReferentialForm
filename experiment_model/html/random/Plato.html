    It is believed that all of

    authentic dialogues survive.
    However, some dialogues ascribed to

    by the Greeks are now considered by the consensus of scholars to be either suspect (e.g., First Alcibiades, Clitophon) or probably spurious (such as Demodocus, or the Second Alcibiades).
    The letters are all considered to probably be spurious, with the possible exception of the Seventh Letter.

    Socrates is often a character in

    dialogues.
    How much of the content and argument of any given dialogue is Socrates' point of view, and how much of it is
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    , is heavily disputed, since Socrates himself did not write anything; this is often referred to as the "Socratic problem".
    However,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Plato
    </span>
    was doubtless strongly influenced by Socrates' teachings, so many of the ideas presented, at least in

    early works, were probably borrowings or adaptations.
