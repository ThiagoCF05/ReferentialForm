    is the site for one of the world's premier astronomical instruments, the Large Millimeter Telescope.

    The name Sierra Negra is confusing, because a 'Sierra' is usually a mountain range rather than a single peak, and there is a Sierra often called the Sierra Negra which lies to the south of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    , along the border of the states of Puebla and Veracruz.
    However, it is the name that occurs on the official INEGI maps and is the one that is most commonly used by English speakers to refer to
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Sierra Negra

    Speakers of Orizaba Nahuatl call
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this mountain
    </span>
    Istaktepetl ikni 'The Brother (or Sister) of the White Mountain' (the Pico de Orizaba being, of course, the White Mountain).
