     Archimedes
    </span>
    (Greek: Ἀ&rho;&chi;&iota;&mu;ή&delta;&eta;&sigmaf;) (c. 287 BC &ndash; 212 BC) was an ancient Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer, and philosopher born in the seaport colony of Syracuse, Magna Graecia, what is now Sicily.
    Many consider
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    one of the greatest, if not the greatest, mathematicians in antiquity.
    Carl Friedrich Gauss, himself frequently called the most influential mathematician of all time, modestly claimed that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Archimedes
    </span>
    was one of the three epoch-making mathematicians (the others being Isaac Newton and Ferdinand Eisenstein).
    Apart from
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    fundamental theoretical contributions to math,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    also shaped the fields of physics and practical engineering, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    has been called "the greatest scientist ever".

   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Archimedes
    </span>
    was a relative of the Hiero monarchy, which was the ruling family of Syracuse (Saracussia), a seaport kingdom.
    King Hiero II, who was rumored to be
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    uncle, commissioned
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    to design and fabricate a new class of ships for his navy, which were crucial for the preservation of the ruling class in Syracuse.
    Hiero II had promised large caches of grain to the Romans in the north in return for peace.
    Faced with war when unable to present the promised amount, Hiero II commissioned
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Archimedes
    </span>
    to develop a large luxury/supply/war barge in order to serve the changing requirements of his navy.
    It is rumored that the Archimedes Screw was actually an invention of happenstance, as
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the ancient Greek mathematician
    </span>
    needed a tool to remove bilge water.
    The ship, coined Saracussia, after its nation, may be mythical.
    There is no record on foundry art, nor any other period pieces depicting its creation.
    It is solely substaintiated by a description from Plato, who said "it was the grandest equation ever to sail."
