     David Thompson
    </span>
    (April 30, 1770 - February 10, 1857), was an English-Canadian map-maker and explorer, known to native peoples as "the Stargazer".
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    was born in London to Welsh parents, and

    died in Montreal (now Quebec, then Canada East in the Province of Canada).

     Thompson
    </span>
    was a fur trader of the Hudson's Bay Company and North West Company.
    In 1785,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Thompson
    </span>
    was sent to Canada to serve with the Hudson's Bay Company, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    served under apprentice for seven years.
    From 1792 to 1812,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Thompson
    </span>
    explored and mapped the country west of Hudson Bay and Lake Superior, across the Rocky Mountains to the headwaters of the Columbia River and down the Columbia to the Pacific Ocean.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    was the first European to explore the Columbia from source to mouth.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Thompson

    joined the Hudson's Bay Company as an apprentice in 1784.
    In 1797,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    left the Hudson's Bay Company and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    joined the North West Company.
    The maps
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    made of the Columbia River basin east of the Cascade Mountains were of such high quality and detail that they continued to be regarded as authoritative well into the mid-20th century.

   <p class="lead">
    The land mass mapped by
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Thompson
    </span>
    amounted to 3.9 million square kilometres of wilderness (one-fifth of the continent).
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    contemporary, the great explorer Alexander Mackenzie, remarked that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    did more in ten months than he would have thought possible in two years.

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    also completed the exacting survey of much of the Canada-U.S. boundary along the 49th parallel in the west, and from the St. Lawrence River to Lake of the Woods.

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    recorded seeing large footprints near what is now Jasper, Alberta, in 1811.
    It has been suggested that these prints were similar to what has since been called the sasquatch.
    However,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Thompson
    </span>
    noted that these tracks showed "a small Nail at the end of each [toe]", and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    stated that these tracks "very much resembles a large Bear's Track".

    honour.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
