    reign is referred to as the Elizabethan era or the Golden Age of Elizabeth.
    Playwrights William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, and Ben Jonson all flourished during this era; Francis Drake became the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe; Francis Bacon laid out his philosophical and political views; and English colonisation of North America took place under Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Humphrey Gilbert.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Elizabeth
    </span>
    was a short-tempered and sometimes indecisive ruler.
    A favourite motto for
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     her
    </span>
    was video et taceo ("I see and keep silent") .
    This last quality, viewed with impatience by

    counsellors, often saved

   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    reign was marked by prudence in the granting of honours and dignities.
    In nearly forty-five years, only nine peerage dignities, one earldom and seven baronies in the Peerage of England, and one barony in the Peerage of Ireland, were created.
