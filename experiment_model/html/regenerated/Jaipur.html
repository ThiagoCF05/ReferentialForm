    is laid out into six quarters, separated by broad streets 111 ft (34 m) wide.
    The urban quarters are further divided by networks of gridded streets.
    Five quarters wrap around the east, south, and west sides of a central palace quarter, with a sixth quarter immediately to the east.
    The Palace quarter encloses a sprawling palace complex (the Hawa Mahal, or palace of winds), formal gardens, and a small lake.
    Nahargarh Fort crowns the hill in the northwest corner of the old city.
    Another noteworthy building is Sawai Jai Singh's observatory, Jantar Mantar.

    is considered by many urbanists to be one of the best planned cities.
    Almost all Indian towns of that period presented a chaotic picture of narrow twisting lanes, a confusion of run-down forts/temples/palaces and temporary shacks that bore no resemblance at all to the principles set out in Hindu architectural manuals, which calls for strict geometric planning.
    Thus, for Sawai Jai Singh II and the Bengali Guru Vidyadhar (who belonged to the 'Shaspati' order of Hindu Priest Architects), the founding of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    was also a ritual and a golden opportunity to plan a whole town according to the principles of Hindu architectural theory.
