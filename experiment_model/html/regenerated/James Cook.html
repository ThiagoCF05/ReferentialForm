     James Cook
    </span>
    FRS RN (October 27, 1728 (O.S.)
    &ndash; February 14, 1779) was an English explorer, navigator and cartographer.
    Ultimately rising to the rank of Captain in the Royal Navy,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    made three voyages to the Pacific Ocean, achieving the first European contact with the eastern coastline of Australia, the European discovery of the Hawaiian Islands, and the first recorded circumnavigation and mapping of Newfoundland and New Zealand.

   <p class="lead">
    After service in the British merchant navy as a teenager,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Cook
    </span>
    joined the Royal Navy in 1755, seeing action in the Seven Years' War, and subsequently surveying and mapping much of the entrance to the Saint Lawrence River during the siege of Quebec.
    This allowed General Wolfe to make his famous stealth attack on the Plains of Abraham, and helped to bring
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    to the attention of the Admiralty and Royal Society at a crucial moment both in
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his

    commission as commander of the HM Bark Endeavour and the first of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    three Pacific voyages in 1766.

   <p class="lead">

    accurately charted many areas and

    recorded several islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His

    huge achievements can be attributed to a combination of excellent seamanship,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    superior surveying and cartographic skills, courage in exploring dangerous locations to confirm the facts (e.g.
    dipping into the Antarctic circle repeatedly and exploring around the Great Barrier Reef), ability to lead men in adverse conditions, and boldness both with regard to the extent of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    explorations and
