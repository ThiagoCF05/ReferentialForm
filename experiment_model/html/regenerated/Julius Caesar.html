     Gāius Jūlius Caesar
    </span>
    (IPA: [IPA: [ˈgaːius ˈjuːlius ˈkaisar]];), July 12 or July 13, 100 BC - March 15, 44 BC) was a Roman military and political leader and one of the most influential men in world history.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into what became the Roman Empire after

    death.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    conquest of Gaul extended the Roman world all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    was also responsible for the first Roman invasion of Britain in 55 BC.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    was widely considered to be one of the foremost military geniuses of

    time, as well as a brilliant politician and one of the ancient world's strongest leaders.

    sparked civil war in 49 BC that left
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    the undisputed master of the Roman world.
    After assuming control of the government,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    began extensive reforms of Roman society and government.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Caesar
    </span>
    was proclaimed dictator for life, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    heavily centralized the bureaucracy of the Republic.
    This forced the hand of a friend of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    , Marcus Junius Brutus, who then conspired with others to murder
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    and restore the Republic.
    This dramatic assassination occurred on the Ides of March (March 15th) in 44 BC and led to another Roman civil war.
    In 42 BC, two years after
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Caesar's
    </span>
    assassination, the Roman Senate officially sanctified
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    as one of the Roman deities.

    military campaigns are known in detail from

    life are recorded by later historians, such as Appian, Suetonius, Plutarch, Cassius Dio and Strabo.
