    The Catalina Highway, also called the Mount Lemmon Highway, as well as the Hitchcock Highway (after Frank Harris Hitchcock, the local newspaper editor who inspired its construction) runs up the Santa Catalina Mountains from the east side of Tucson up to Summerhaven, at the top of

     Mt. Lemmon
    </span>
    .
    The beautiful, curving road is a favorite drive for tourists, for locals escaping summer's heat, for motorcyclists, and cyclists.
    The highway has been improved recently, but the speed limit has also been lowered to 35 MPH (56 km/h) due to concerns about the highway's safety during peak traffic times.

    </span>
    , starts in Oracle, which is on state highway 77 northeast of Tucson.
    It offers a secondary route to the top.
    Follow East Mount Lemmon Road southeast off East American Avenue.
    This route is popular with off-road 4x4 drivers and with off-road or dual-purpose motorcyclists, but should not be attempted by regular passenger cars or street motorcycles.
    This road ends at the Catalina Highway near Loma Linda.
