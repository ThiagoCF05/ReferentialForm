     The Mulanje Massif
    </span>
    , also known as Mount Mulanje, is a large monadnock in southern Malawi near the city of Blantyre, rising sharply from the surrounding plains of Chiradzulu, and the tea-growing Mulanje district.

    has a maximum elevation of 3,002m at

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    has many individual peaks reaching heights of over 2500m, including Chambe Peak, the West Face of which is the longest rock climb in Africa.

    was formed by the extrusion of magma into the earth's crust about 130 million years ago.
    The surrounding rock eroded away over time, leaving behind the erosion-resistant igneous rock of

    The first European to report seeing

    was David Livingstone in 1859, but archeological investigation reveals evidence of human visits to

    The forested slopes of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mulanje Massif
    </span>
    support a sizable timber industry.
    At one time there was a cableway to transport timber from the edge of the plateau down to the Likhubula Forestry Station, but it fell into disrepair, and currently planks are carried down manually.

     Mulanje Massif itself
    </span>
    is part of the protected Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve.
    The native Mulanje Cypress (Widdringtonia whytei) has been so heavily logged that it is considered endangered and the park contains the last remaining stands of this tree, as well as a number of other plant and animal species&mdash; many of them endemic to the area.
    Examples include forest butterfies, birds such as the cholo alethe and White-winged Apalis, Dwarf Chameleon, geckos, skinks, the Squeaker Frog, and a rare limbless burrowing skink species.
    The land around the park is threatened by growing population, land use patterns such as forest clearing for farming and firewood, and invasive species such as Mexican Pine and Himalayan Raspberry.
