    Following the retreat of the glaciers from this area at the end of the last ice age, the Ottawa River valley was flooded by an arm of the Atlantic Ocean known as the Champlain Sea.
    Fossil remains of marine life have been found in marine clay formed during that time.
    Sediment deposits from this period have resulted in areas of poor drainage and the presence of large bogs in some ancient channels of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the Ottawa River
    </span>
    .
    Another consequence was the formations of large deposits of a material commonly known as Leda clay; these deposits become highly unstable after heavy rains.
    A number of landslides have occurred as a result.
    The former site of the town of Lemieux, Ontario collapsed into the South Nation River in 1993; however, the residents had already been relocated due to the suspected instability of the earth in that location.

    Large numbers of Canada Geese, ducks, gulls and shorebirds take advantage of spring flooding and wetlands in the Ottawa River valley during migration.
    Ducks also overwinter in sections of
