     Paul of Tarsus
    </span>
    (d. c. 65), St. Paul, known as the Apostle to the Gentiles, was the most notable Christian missionary, together with the apostle St. Peter.
    Unlike Peter,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    did not know Jesus in life but
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    was converted by a miraculous vision known as the "Road to Damascus".
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Paul
    </span>
    was the second most prolific contributor to the New Testament (after St. Luke).
    Fourteen letters were attributed to
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    , with greater or lesser degrees of confidence, which contain the earliest systematic account of Christian doctrine and providing information on the life of the infant Church.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    letters are arguably the oldest part of the New Testament.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    also appears in the pages of St. Luke&rsquo;s second volume, the Acts of the Apostles, so that it is possible to compare the account of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    life in the Acts, with
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    own account in
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    various letters.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    letters are largely written to churches which
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    had founded or visited;
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    was a great traveller, going to Cyprus, Asia Minor (modern Turkey), mainland Greece, Crete and Rome bringing the gospel of Jesus Christ, first to Jews and then to Gentiles.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    letters are full of expositions of what Christians should believe and how they should live; what
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    does not do is to tell
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    correspondents (or the modern reader) much about the life and teachings of Jesus.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    most explicit references are to the Last Supper, the crucifixion and the resurrection; raising the question, still disputed, as to how consistent
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    version of the Christian faith is with that of the Gospels.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    influence on Christian thinking has, arguably been more significant than any one other New Testament writer.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Paul's
    </span>
    works were hugely influential on some of the great Christian thinkers and leaders of movements, including St. Augustine of Hippo and Martin Luther the instigator of the European Protestant Reformation and even upon the German church in the twentieth century through the interpretive writings of the scholar Karl Barth.
