    , Baron de Coubertin (January 1, 1863 - September 2, 1937), was a French pedagogue and historian best known for being founder of the modern Olympic Games.

    was inspired by

    visits to British and American colleges and universities, and

    set out to improve
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his

    education.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     The French pedagogue
    </span>
    thought part of this improvement should be sports education, which
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    considered an important part of the personal development of young people.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    was particularly fond of rugby and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    was the referee of the first ever French championship rugby union final on March 20, 1892 between Racing Club de France and Stade Fran&ccedil;ais.

    conceived of an international competition to promote athletics.
    A growing international interest in the ancient Olympics, fed by recent archaeological finds at Olympia,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    devised a plan to revive the Olympic Games.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    To publicize these plans,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     De Coubertin
    </span>
    organised an international congress on June 23, 1894 at the Sorbonne in Paris.
    There
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    proposed to reinstate the ancient Olympic Games.
    The congress led to the establishing of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), of which
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     De Coubertin
    </span>
    became the general secretary.
    It was also decided that the first modern Olympics would take place in Athens, Greece and that they would be held every four years.
    These Games proved a success, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     De Coubertin
    </span>
    took over the IOC presidency when Demetrius Vikelas stepped down after the Olympics in his own country.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    Despite the initial success, the Olympic Movement faced hard times, as the 1900 (in
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     De Coubertin's
    </span>
    own Paris) and 1904 Games were both swallowed by international fairs, and received little attention.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    This changed for the better after the 1906 Summer Olympics, and the Olympic Games grew to become the most important sports event.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     De Coubertin

    created the modern pentathlon for the 1912 Olympics, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    </span>
    subsequently stepped down from
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    IOC presidency after the 1924 Olympics in Paris, which proved much more successful than the first attempt in that city in 1900.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     De Coubertin

    was succeeded as president by Belgian Henri de Baillet-Latour.

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
