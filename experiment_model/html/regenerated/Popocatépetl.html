    spewed gas and ash which was carried as far as 25 km away by prevailing winds.
    The activity prompted the evacuation of nearby towns and scientists to begin monitoring for an eruption.
    In December 2000, tens of thousands of people were evacuated by the government based on the warnings of scientists.
