      Mount Hubbard

     is one of the major mountains of the Saint Elias Range.
     <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
      It
     </span>
     is located on the Alaska/Yukon border; the Canadian side is within Kluane National Park and Reserve, and the American side is part of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park.
     <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
      The mountain
     </span>
     was named in 1890 by USGS geologist Israel Russell after Gardiner Greene Hubbard, first president of the National Geographic Society, which had co-sponsored Russell's expedition.

     is the highest point of a large massif with three named summits; the other two are Mount Alverstone and Mount Kennedy.
     Alverstone and Hubbard form a corner of the U.S.-Canadian border: the border extends roughly south from these peaks toward the Alaska panhandle, and roughly west toward Mount Saint Elias, approximately 100 km (60 mi) away.
     The Hubbard Glacier separates

     from Mount Vancouver to the west, while the Lowell Glacier lies to the east of the peak.

     <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
      Mount Hubbard

     is just over 20 miles (32 km) from tidewater at Disenchantment Bay.
