     A very popular hike is to make a loop combining the three most notable summits of the Franconia Range.
     The loop starts with the Old Bridle Path to the AMC Greenleaf Hut.

     Turning south along the Franconia Ridge Trail, one passes over Mount Lincoln and Little Haystack, then descends via the Falling Waters Trail, which connects back with the beginning of the Old Bridle Path.
     This loop is 8.9 miles long, with a cumulative vertical elevation gain of about 3900 feet.
