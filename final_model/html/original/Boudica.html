    In 60 or 61, while governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus was leading a campaign on the island of Anglesey in north Wales,

    </span>
    led the Iceni, along with the Trinovantes and others, in a rebellion which destroyed the former Trinovantian capital and Roman colonia of Camulodunum (Colchester), and routed the Roman Legio IX Hispana under Quintus Petillius Cerialis.

    army then burned to the ground the twenty-year-old settlement of Londinium (London) and destroyed Verulamium (St Albans), killing an estimated 70,000-80,000 people.
    Roman emperor Nero briefly considered withdrawing Roman forces from the island, but ultimately

    was defeated at the Battle of Watling Street by the heavily outnumbered forces of governor Suetonius.
