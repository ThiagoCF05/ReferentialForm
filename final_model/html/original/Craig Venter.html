     John Craig Venter

    (born October 14, 1946, Salt Lake City) is an American biologist and businessman.

    On returning,

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his

    Ph.D. in physiology and pharmacology in 1975, both from the University of California, San Diego.
    After working as a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo,

    While at NIH,

    learned of a technique for rapidly identifying all of the mRNAs present in a cell, and

    began to use it to rapidly identify human brain genes.
    The short cDNA sequence fragments discovered by this method are called Expressed sequence tags, or ESTs, a name coined by Anthony Kerlavage at The Institute for Genomic Research.
    In a controversial court case,

    was the former president and founder of Celera Genomics, which became famous for running a parallel version of the Human Genome Project of its own for commercial purposes, using shotgun sequencing technology in 1999.
    The aim of the Celera project was to create a database of genomic data that user could subscribe to for a fee.
    This proved very unpopular in the genetics community and spurred several groups to redouble their efforts to produce the full sequence and release it as open access.
    The Human Genome Project, which was composed of many groups from around the world, rendered the attempt to privatise the process unfeasible.

    DNA from 5 individuals was used by Celera to generate the sequence of the human genome; one of the 5 individuals used in this project was
