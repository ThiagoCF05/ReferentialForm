     Sir Frederick Grant Banting
    </span>
    , KBE , MC , MD , FRSC (November 14, 1891 - February 21, 1941) was a Canadian medical scientist, doctor and Nobel laureate noted as one of the co-discovers of insulin.

     Banting
    </span>
    was born in Alliston, Ontario, Canada.
    After studying medicine at the University of Toronto and graduating in 1916,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    served in the Canadian Army Medical Corps during World War I.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    won the Military Cross during the war.After the war,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    returned to Canada and between 1919 and 1920
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    completed
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    training as an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.
    In July 1920
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    began to practice medicine in London, Ontario and give lectures on endocrinology at the University of Western Ontario.
    There, on the night of 31 October, 1920, during
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    routine reading of articles in a medical journal,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    wrote down an idea for a method to isolate the internal secretion of the pancreas, the crucial step needed for effective treatment for diabetes.
    Up to that point, all methods to obtain a useful secretion which could be safely administered to humans had proved unsuccessful.Dissatisfied with
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    practice and fascinated by
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    idea,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Banting
    </span>
    left London and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    moved to Toronto.
    There, on 17 May, 1921
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    began
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    research at the University of Toronto, under the supervision of professor John Macleod.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    was assigned a single assistant to help
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    , the young graduate student Charles Best.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    During a summer of intense work,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Banting
    </span>
    tested
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    idea, performing operations on dogs to tie up their pancreatic ducts, which resulted in a partial atrophy of the pancreas.
    The pancreas would be then removed some weeks later, with the hope that it would then contain a high concentration of uncontaminated secretion of the pancreas.
    An extract would then be made from it and administered to dogs with diabetes, to test whether it could treat their diabetes through lowering the blood sugar level.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    After some months of work, it appeared to
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Banting
    </span>
    that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    method was working, and that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    could keep dogs with diabetes alive with
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    extract.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    enthusiastically reported
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    findings to Macleod, who had been away on his summer holidays during this time.
    In retrospect, some claim that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Banting's
    </span>
    experiments were crude and did not prove the validity of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    idea, which was not physiologically sound in any case.
    However, the results encouraged further intensive work in the fall, with direct participation by Macleod and the chemist James Collip.
    The use of dog pancreases proved impractical and was soon abandoned in favour of using pancreas from calves and cows.
    The technique of tying pancreatic ducts was also discarded, with all the efforts concentrated on developing methods to extract a useful extract from a normal pancreas.
    The efforts of the team in 1921-1922 culminated in developing the ability to obtain a useful extract, named insulin.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    This was one of the most significant advances in medicine at the time.
    Insulin was not only discovered, but put into mass production in a matter of months.
    Hence, almost immediately it began to extend the lives of millions of people worldwide who suffered from the endocrine disease diabetes mellitus that could not be treated and had a very poor prognosis.
    People suffered from problems with fat and protein metabolism, leading to blindness and then death only a short time after the onset of the illness.
    Leonard Thompson was the first person to be administered.

   <p class="lead">
    In 1923
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Banting
    </span>
    and Macleod received the Nobel Prize in Medicine.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Banting
    </span>
    shared the award money with Best, believing that Best deserved the Prize more than Macleod, who in turn shared his award money with Collip.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Banting
    </span>
    was widely esteemed in Canada as the first Canadian to achieve worldwide scientific fame.
    The Canadian government gave
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    a lifetime grant for
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    research.
    In 1934 King George V bestowed a knighthood on
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    , making
