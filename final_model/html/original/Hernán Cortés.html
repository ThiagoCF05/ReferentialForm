    , Marqu&eacute;s del Valle de Oaxaca (1485-December 2, 1547) was the conquistador
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     who
    </span>
    became famous for leading the military expedition that initiated the Spanish Conquest of Mexico.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    was part of the generation of European colonizers that began the first phase of the Spanish colonization of the Americas.

    was known as Hernando or Fernando Cort&eacute;s during

    Born in Medellin, Extremadura, in Castile, to a family of lesser nobility,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Cort&eacute;s
    </span>
    as a young man chose to win a livelihood in the New World.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    went to Hispaniola and later to Cuba, where
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    received an encomienda and for a period
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    became mayor of a small town.
    In 1519
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    was elected captain of the third expedition to the mainland, an expedition which
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    partly funded.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    enmity with the governor of Cuba Diego Vel&aacute;zquez resulted in the latter calling back the expedition in the last moment, an order which was ignored by
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Cort&eacute;s
    </span>
    in an act of disobedience.
    Arriving on the continent
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Cort&eacute;s
    </span>
    executed a successful strategy of allying with some indigenous peoples against others.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    also successfully used a native woman, Do&ntilde;a Marina, as interpreter and later she became mother of a son to

    .

    </span>
    won and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    used the extra troops as reinforcements.
    Instead
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    wrote letters directly to the king asking to be acknowledged for
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    successes instead of punished for mutiny.
    When the Aztec empire was overthrown
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Cort&eacute;s
    </span>
    was awarded the title of Marques del Valle de Oaxaca, while the more prestigious titles of Viceroy was given to relatives of the king.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Cort&eacute;s
    </span>
    returned to Spain where
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    died peacefully but embittered.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    Due to the controversial undertakings of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Cort&eacute;s
    </span>
    and the scarcity of reliable sources of information about
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    it has become difficult to assert anything definitive about
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    personality and motivations.
    Early heroification of the conquistadors did not encourage deep examination of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Cort&eacute;s
    </span>
    .
    Later reconsideration of the conquistadors' character in the context of modern anti-colonial sentiment and greatly expanded concern for human rights, as typified by the Black Legend, also did little to expand our understanding of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
