     Mam Tor
    </span>
    is a 517 m (1696 ft) high peak near Castleton in the High Peak of Derbyshire, England.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Its
    </span>
    name literally translates as Heights of the Mother and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    is also known as the Shivering Mountain on account of the instability of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     its
    </span>
    lower shale layers.
    Indeed, in 1979 the continual battle to maintain the A625 road (Sheffield to Chapel en le Frith) on the crumbling southern side of

    was lost when the road officially closed as a through-route.

    The summit of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mam Tor
    </span>
    is encircled by a late Bronze Age and early Iron Age hill fort.
    Radiocarbon analysis suggests occupation from around 1200 BC.
    The earliest remaining features are two Bronze Age burial mounds, one just below the summit and the other on the summit itself.
    At a later stage over a hundred small platforms were levelled into
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the hill

    near the summit, allowing inhabited timber huts to be constructed.

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     The Tor

    sits near the top of Winnats Pass (a steep and narrow limestone gorge),
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    </span>
    forms the eastern end of Rushup Edge, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    </span>
    dominates the western end of the "Great Ridge", one of the most famous, beautiful, and easy-to-reach ridgewalks in the Peak District.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    The Ridge separates the two arms of the Hope Valley: the valley of the River Noe (Edale) to the north, and the Peakshole Water (Castleton) to the south.
    Starting at the western end, the walker leaves the summit of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mam Tor
    </span>
    , passes the remains of the fort's earthworks, dips into the saddle of Hollins Cross, climbs to Back Tor, then dips and climbs again to the conical peak of Lose Hill at the eastern end of the Ridge.
    In the other direction, walkers who have climbed Lose Hill from Hope railway station see
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mam Tor
    </span>
    as a dramatic target for an easy one-hour walk with beautiful views on either side.
    A common target for walkers from Edale or Castleton is the dip of Hollins Cross, the meeting place of many paths visible from the valley bottoms on both sides.
    Other walkers take the longer route past the show caves (i.e.
    via Winnats Pass or the old A-road) or Barber Booth.
    Back Tor has a steep and distinctive shale face, which is occasionally climbable when hard-frozen.
