    , along with the nearby peak known as Thunder Mountain, is currently home to the family owned and operated ski resort Mount Baldy Ski Lifts, the closest resort to Los Angeles.
    Nearby lies Mt.
    Baldy Village, a small seasonal community.
    The village has its own fire department, church, visitor's center, and one-school school district; Mt.
    Baldy School (the abbreviation is the standard usage) has about 88 students.

    Between 1922 and 1927, American physicist Albert Michelson performed a number of experiments involving bouncing a beam of light onto a reflector at Lookout Mountain, a prominent bump on the south ridge of

     the mountain
    </span>
    3km SW of the peak, from the observatory at Mount Wilson some 22 miles distant.
    The exact distance was very accurately surveyed and using the measurements the speed of light was calculated to be 299,796&plusmn;4 km/s.

    Nearby is San Antonio Creek, the location of San Antonio Falls.
    The creek cascades through a gorge about three times, the final of which is about a 75 foot drop.
