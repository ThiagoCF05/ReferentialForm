     Ren&eacute; Descartes
    </span>
    (March 31, 1596 - February 11, 1650), also known as Cartesius, was a noted French  philosopher, mathematician, and scientist.
    Dubbed the "Founder of Modern Philosophy" and the "Father of Modern Mathematics,"
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    ranks as one of the most important and influential thinkers of modern times.
    For good or bad, much of subsequent western philosophy is a reaction to
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    writings, which have been closely studied from
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    time down to the present day.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Descartes
    </span>
    was one of the key thinkers of the Scientific Revolution in the Western World.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    influence in mathematics is also apparent, the Cartesian coordinate system used in plane geometry and algebra being named after
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    .
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Descartes
    </span>
    frequently contrasted
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    views with those of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    predecessors.
    In the opening section of the ''Passions of the Soul'',
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    goes so far as to assert that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    will write on
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    topic "as if no one had written on these matters before".
    Nevertheless many elements of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    philosophy have precedents in late Aristotelianism, the revived Stoicism of the 16th century, or in earlier philosophers like Augustine.
    In
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    natural philosophy,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    differs from the Schools on two major points: first,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    rejects the analysis of corporeal substance into matter and form; second,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    rejects any appeal to ends --divine or natural-- in explaining natural phenomena.
    In
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    theology,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    insists on the absolute freedom of God&rsquo;s act of creation.

     Descartes
    </span>
    was a major figure in 17th century continental rationalism, later advocated by Baruch Spinoza and Gottfried Leibniz, and opposed by the empiricist school of thought, consisting of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume.
    Leibniz, Spinoza and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Descartes
    </span>
    were all versed in mathematics as well as philosophy, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Descartes
    </span>
    and Leibniz contributed greatly to science as well.
    As the inventor of the Cartesian coordinate system,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Descartes
    </span>
    founded analytic geometry, that bridge between algebra and geometry crucial to the invention of the calculus and analysis.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Descartes'
    </span>
    reflections on mind and mechanism began the strain of western thought that much later, impelled by the invention of the electronic computer and by the possibility of machine intelligence, blossomed into, e.g., the Turing test.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    most famous statement is ''Cogito ergo sum'' (French: ''Je pense, donc je suis'' or in English: ''I think, therefore I am''), found in &sect;7 of ''Principles of Philosophy'' (Latin) and part IV of ''Discourse on Method'' (French).
