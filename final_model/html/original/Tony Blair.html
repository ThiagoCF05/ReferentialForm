    became leader of the British Labour Party in July 1994 following the sudden death of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    predecessor, John Smith.
    Under
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Blair's
    </span>
    leadership, the party won a landslide victory in the May 1997 general election, ending 18 years of government by the UK's centre-right Conservative Party.

    is the Labour Party's longest-serving Prime Minister, the only person to have led the party to three consecutive general election victories and the only Labour prime minister to serve more than one full consecutive term.

    Together with Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Blair
    </span>
    is both credited and criticised for moving the Labour Party towards the centre of British politics, using the term "New Labour" to distinguish
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    pro-market policies from the more collectivist policies which the party had espoused in the past.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Blair
    </span>
    has described
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his

    political philosophy as "modern social democracy" and "the third way".

    In domestic government policy,

     Blair

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Blair's

    tenure has also seen the introduction of the minimum wage, constitutional reform such as devolution in Scotland and Wales, and progress in the Northern Ireland peace process.

    Since the advent of the War on Terror in 2001, a significant part of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    political agenda has been dominated by foreign affairs.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Blair

    has strongly supported a number of aspects of US foreign policy, notably by participating in the invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003.

    has encountered fierce criticism as a result, and the circumstances in which

    took Britain to war in Iraq have caused many opponents of the war to perceive

    as dishonest.
