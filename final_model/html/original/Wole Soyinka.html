    A great deal of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    writing has been concerned with "the oppressive boot and the irrelevance of the colour of the foot that wears it".
    This activism has often exposed

    to great personal risk, most notable during the government of the Nigerian dictator General Sani Abacha (1993-1998).
