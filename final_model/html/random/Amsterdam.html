    has one of the largest historic city centres in Europe, dating largely from the 17th century.
    At this time, a series of concentric, semi-circular canals ("grachten") were dug around the old city centre.
    Along the canals houses and warehouses were built.
    The canals still define
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     its
    </span>
    layout and appearance today.
    Many fine houses and mansions are situated along the canals.
    Some of the narrow brick houses are gradually sinking because they are built on wooden piles to cope with the marshy subsoil.
