    The hill is crowned by the ruins of the old castle, which add to the picturesqueness of the view; little else is preserved of the old town, which was not well built.
    Many of its houses were constructed of sun-dried mud bricks along narrow streets.
    There are, however, many finely preserved remains of Greek, Roman and Byzantine architecture, the most remarkable being the Temple of Augustus (20 BC) also known as the Monumentum Ancyranum
