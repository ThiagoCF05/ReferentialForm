    (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor; born 21 April 1926) is Queen of 16 sovereign states, holding each crown and title equally, though
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Elizabeth

    is more directly involved with the United Kingdom, where the Royal Family resides, and the Monarchy is historically indigenous.

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the Queen of 16 sovereign states , holding each crown
    </span>
    is the most powerful head of state in the world, although in practice
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Elizabeth
    </span>
    personally exercises very little political executive power.
