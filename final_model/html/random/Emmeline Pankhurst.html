     The one of the founders of the British suffragette
    </span>
    (July 14, 1858 &ndash; June 14, 1928) was one of the founders of the British suffragette movement.
    It is the name of "Mrs Pankhurst", more than any other, which is associated with the struggle for the enfranchisement of women in the period immediately preceding World War I.

    married Richard Marsden Pankhurst, a barrister, in Salford in 1879.
    Dr Pankhurst was already a supporter of the women's suffrage movement, and had been the author of the Married Women's Property Acts of 1870 and 1882.
    In 1889,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    </span>
    founded the Women's Franchise League, but
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    campaign was interrupted by

    husband's death in 1898.
    In 1903
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mrs Pankhurst
    </span>
    founded the better-known Women's Social and Political Union, an organization most famous for its militancy which began in 1905.
    Its members included Annie Kenney, Emily Wilding Davison who was killed by the King's horse in the 1913 Epsom Derby as the result of a suffragette protest, and the composer Dame Ethel Mary Smyth.

    In 1914, the First World War broke out, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mrs Pankhurst
    </span>
    felt that nothing should interfere with
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     her
    </span>
    country's efforts to win.
    All attempts to gain votes for women were put on hold, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this one of the founders of the British suffragette's
    </span>
    efforts were instead directed to urging women to take over men's jobs, so that the men could go and fight in the war.
    With back up from David Lloyd George,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this one of the founders of the British suffragette
    </span>
    organised a parade of 30,000 women, using &pound;2,000 funding from the government, to encourage employers to let women take over men's jobs in industry.
    In 1916, this allowed the government to draft all able-bodied men into the armed services.
    It is frequently alleged that suffragettes had earlier been involved in the "White Feather Campaign" which involved shaming of men in the UK to fight in the First World War in which 702,000 men from the UK died and many more were injured; however, there is no concrete evidence of this.

    "Characteristically, Mrs. Pankhurst threw all her energies and all her influence into the effort, which now, designated itself pro-war and pro-conscription.
    Although not all of the members of the suffrage movement backed the war, Mrs. Pankhurst&rsquo;s influence swayed many to follow her lead.
    Giving its energies wholly to the prosecution of the War, it rushed to a furious extreme, its Chauvinism unexampled amongst all the other women&rsquo;s societies" (Pankhurst, Sylvia 593).
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    Enlistment of the unenlisted was of the highest priority.
    As Sylvia Pankhurst points out in her chronicle, The Suffragette Movement,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mrs Pankhurst

    and sister rallied their followers in an effort to reroute the militant momentum which they had so successfully orchestrated in the struggle for suffrage:

   <p class="lead">
    On September 8, 1914, Christabel re-appeared at the London Opera House, after her long exile, to utter a declaration, not on women&rsquo;s enfranchisement, but on "The German Peril".

    supporters handed the white feather to every young man they encountered wearing civilian dress, and bobbed up at Hyde Park meetings with placards: "Intern Them All".

    Britain started to implement voting rights for women, in the same year as Ireland, in March 1918.
    While the Representation of the People Act 1918 only gave voting rights to women over 30, and that with a property qualification, while all men over 21 were enfranchised, the Suffragettes nevertheless saw it as a great victory.
    In November 1918, women over 21 were given the right to become Members of Parliament.
    This led to a situation where a woman could be an MP even though she was too young to vote.
    Women finally achieved equal voting rights to men in the UK in 1928.
