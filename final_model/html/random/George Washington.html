    was later elected the first President of the United States.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This first President

    served two four-year terms from 1789 to 1797, having been reelected in 1792.
    Because of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President's
    </span>
    central role in the founding of the United States,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President
    </span>
    is often referred to as the "Father of his Country".
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This first President's
    </span>
    devotion to republicanism and civic virtue made
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    an exemplary figure among early American politicians.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    In
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President's
    </span>
    youth,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Washington
    </span>
    worked as a surveyor of rural lands and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    acquired what would become invaluable knowledge of the terrain around
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    </span>
    native Virginia.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This first President

    gained command experience during the French and Indian War (1754&ndash;1763).
    Due to this experience,

    military bearing,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    enormous charisma, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President's

    political base in Virginia, the Second Continental Congress chose
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President
    </span>
    as commander-in-chief of the American forces.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This first President

    scored a victory by forcing the British out of Boston in 1776, but later that year
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    was badly defeated and nearly captured when
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President
    </span>
    lost New York City.
    By crossing the Delaware and defeating enemy units in New Jersey in the dead of winter,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President
    </span>
    revived the "Patriot" cause.
    As a result of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Washington's
    </span>
    strategic oversight, Revolutionary forces captured the two main British combat armies, first at Saratoga in 1777 and then at Yorktown in 1781.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     The first President
    </span>
    handled relations with the states and their militias,

    dealt with disputing generals and colonels, and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    worked with Congress to supply and recruit the Continental army.
    Negotiating with Congress, the states, and French allies,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President
    </span>
    held together a fragile army and a fragile nation despite the constant threat of disintegration.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    Following the end of the war, when it was widely believed that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President
    </span>
    could have installed
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President
    </span>
    as King of the victorious nation,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Washington
    </span>
    chose instead to observe the practice of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the first President's
    </span>
    role model, the ancient Roman general Cincinnatus, and retire to
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the first President's
    </span>
    plantation on Mount Vernon, an exemplar of the republican ideal of citizen leadership.
    Later, alarmed at the many weaknesses of the new nation under the Articles of Confederation,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President
    </span>
    presided over the Constitutional Convention that drafted the much stronger United States Constitution in 1787.

   <p class="lead">
    In 1789,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Washington
    </span>
    became President of the United States and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    promptly established many of the customs and usages of the new government's executive department.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     The first President

    sought to create a great nation capable of surviving in a world torn asunder by war between Britain and France.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This first President's
    </span>
    Neutrality Proclamation of 1793 provided a basis for avoiding any involvement in foreign conflicts.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    supported Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton's plans to build a strong central government by funding the national debt, implementing an effective tax system, and creating a national bank.
    When rebels in Pennsylvania defied Federal authority,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Washington
    </span>
    rode at the head of the army to authoritatively quell the Whiskey Rebellion.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This first President

    avoided the temptation of war and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    began a decade of peace with Britain via the Jay Treaty in 1795;

    used
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    immense prestige to get it ratified over intense opposition from the Jeffersonians.
    Although
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President
    </span>
    never officially joined the Federalist Party,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President

    supported its programs and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    was its inspirational leader.
    By refusing to pursue a third term,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President
    </span>
    made it the enduring norm that no U.S. President should seek more than two.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This first President's
    </span>
    Farewell address was a primer on republican virtue and a stern warning against involvement in foreign wars.

   <p class="lead">
    As the symbol of republicanism in practice,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    embodied American values and across the world

    was seen as the symbol of the new nation.
    Scholars perennially rank
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Washington

    among the three greatest U.S. Presidents.
    And no one, even today, presumes to challenge the funeral oration of Henry Lee that among all Americans,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President
    </span>
    was "first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen" (see Legacy, below).
