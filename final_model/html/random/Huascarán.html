    or Nevado Huascar&aacute;n is a mountain in the Province of Yungay-Cordillera Blanca, part of the Western Andes.
    At 6768 m,

    </span>
    southern peak (Huascar&aacute;n Sur) is the highest in Peru and the fourth highest in South America, although a lower height of 6746m from a more recent survey is also often quoted.

    was named after Hu&aacute;scar, a 16th century Inca chieftain who was the heir to the Inca empire.
    The summit was first reached in July 1932 by a joint German-Austrian expedition.
    The north peak (Huascar&aacute;n Norte) had previously been climbed (1908) by a US expedition that included Annie Smith Peck.
    The core of

    On 31 May 1970 the Ancash earthquake caused a substantial part of the north side of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    </span>
    to collapse.
    The block of falling ice and rock was about 1 mile long, half a mile wide, and half a mile deep.
    In about five minutes it flowed 11 miles to Yungay, burying the entire town under ice and rock, and causing the deaths of more than 20,000 people.
    At that moment there was a Czechoslovakian mountaineering team on

    is normally climbed from the village of Musho to the west via a high camp in the col that separates the summits, known as La Garganta.
    The ascent normally takes 5-7 days, the main difficulties being the large crevasses that often block the route.
