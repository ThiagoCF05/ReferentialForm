     Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni
    </span>
    (March 6, 1475 - February 18, 1564), commonly known as Michelangelo, was an Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect and poet.
    Despite making few forays beyond the arts,

     his

    versatility in the disciplines

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Michelangelo's
    </span>
    rival and fellow Florentine Leonardo da Vinci.

    output in every field during
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his

    long life was prodigious; when the sheer volume of correspondence, sketches and reminiscences that survive is also taken into account,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    is the best-documented artist of the 16th century.
    Two of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    best-known works, the Pieta  and the David, were sculpted in
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    late twenties to early thirties.
    Despite
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    low opinion of painting,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Michelangelo
    </span>
    also created two of the most influential fresco paintings in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling and The Last Judgement on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Rome.
    Later in life

    Uniquely for a Renaissance artist, two biographies were published of

    </span>
    during
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    own lifetime.
    One of them, by Giorgio Vasari, proposed that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    was the pinnacle of all artistic achievement since the beginning of the Renaissance, a viewpoint that continued to have currency in art history for centuries.

    lifetime
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    was also often called Il Divino ("the divine one"), an appropriate sobriquet given

    intense spirituality.
    One of the qualities most admired by

    contemporaries was
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    impassioned and highly personal style that resulted in the next major movement in Western art after the High Renaissance, Mannerism.
