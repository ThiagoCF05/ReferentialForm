    is the second highest peak in Glacier National Park, located in Montana, United States.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mount Stimson

    is part of the Lewis Range, which spans much of the park.

    is located in the remote southwestern portion of the park, approximately 5 miles (8 km) west of the Continental Divide and 12 miles (19 km) southeast of Lake McDonald.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    is drained by Pinchot Creek (on the south) and Nyack Creek (on the other sides), both of which flow into the Middle Fork of the Flathead River.

    is named for Henry L. Stimson (1867 &ndash; 1950), former U.S. Secretary of State.

    is one of the furthest peaks from a roadhead in the park.

   <p class="lead">
    The first recorded ascent of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    was in 1951, by J. Gordon Edwards and Alice Edwards; however they found clear evidence of a previous ascent.
    The standard route of ascent is the West (or Northwest) Face Route, starting from Nyack Creek.
    (A backpacking trail runs along Nyack Creek, providing access; however the Park Service warns that this is a more brushy and isolated trail than in other areas of the park, with numerous unbridged stream crossings.
    As in the rest of the park, grizzly bears are an issue as well.)
    The climbing route begins with "tiresome uphill bushwhacking...for possibly three hours" leading to alternating slopes and cliffs (Grades 3 and 4).
    (Edwards 1995:330)Other routes on
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this mountain
    </span>
    include the Southeast Spur (from Martha's Basin) and the Pinchot Creek Route (from the south).
