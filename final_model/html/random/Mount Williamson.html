    , at 14,403 feet (4,390 m), is the second highest mountain in both the Sierra Nevada range, and the state of California.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    is the sixth highest peak in the contiguous United States.

    lies in the John Muir Wilderness of the Inyo National Forest.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    is located approximately 6 miles (9 km) north of Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the contiguous US, and about 2.5 miles (4 km) southeast of Shepherd Pass, the nearest trail access.
    The closest town is Independence, California, about 11.8 miles (19 km) north-north-east of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    </span>
    in the Owens Valley.

   <p class="lead">
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This mountain
    </span>
    lies about 1 mile (1.6 km) east of the High Sierra crest, which forms the western edge of the Owens Valley.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     This mountain
    </span>
    is more remote than Whitney in terms of access; however
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain
    </span>
    is actually a bit closer to the Owens Valley floor than Whitney.
    For example, the drop from the summit to the forest edge is 8,000 feet (2,430 m) in approximately 4 miles (6.4 km).
    This makes
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain
    </span>
    an imposing mountain, though far less of a popular climb than
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     its
    </span>
    higher neighbor.

   <p class="lead">
    The standard ascent route is the West Side Route, accessed from Shepherd's Pass.
    From the pass, one travels across the Williamson Bowl, which lies between
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    and Mount Tyndall, part of the Sierra Crest.
    The bowl is home to five high alpine lakes.
    From the bowl, the route climbs gullies up the west face to the relatively broad summit plateau; this portion involves scrambling up to Class 3.
    Technically easier, but with a much more difficult approach, is the Southeast Slopes Route, rising from George Creek.
    Other routes exist on
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this mountain
    </span>
    , including a significant technical route on the North Rib (Grade IV, 5.7).

   <p class="lead">
    Climbing
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain
    </span>
    is made more difficult by two factors: first is the length and difficulty of the approach.
    Elevation gain from the trailhead is over 8,000 feet (2,430 m), and the trail to Shepherd's Pass alone is 11 miles (18 km).
    Second,

    The first recorded ascent of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this mountain
    </span>
    was made in 1884 by W. L. Hunter and C. Mulholland, via the Southeast Slopes Route.
    The first ascent of the West Side Route was made in 1896 by Bolton C. Brown and Lucy Brown.
    New routes continued to be put up on the harder faces at least through the 1970s.

    is named after Lt. Robert Stockton Williamson (1825-1882), who conducted one of the Pacific Railroad Surveys in Southern California.
