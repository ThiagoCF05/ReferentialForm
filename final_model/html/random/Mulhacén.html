    The south flank of

    is gentle, and presents no technical challenge, as is the case for the long west ridge.
    The shorter, somewhat steeper north east ridge is slightly more technical.
    The north face of

    can be climbed in a single day from the villages of either Capileira or Trevelez, but it is more common to spend a night at the mountain refuge at Poqueira, or in the bare shelter at Caldera to the west.
    Those making the ascent from Trevelez can also bivouac at the tarns to the northeast of

    On March 7, 2006 three British climbers from Teesside died on
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    from suspected hypothermia.
    Initial reports quoting the Spanish Civil Guard stated that the three were ill-equipped for the extreme conditions.
    This claim was subsequently disputed both by the family and a colleague of one of the climbers, and by one of the rescuers.
