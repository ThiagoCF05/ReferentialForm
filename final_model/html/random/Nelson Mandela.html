    (IPA ) (born July 18, 1918) was the first President of South Africa to be elected in fully-representative democratic elections.

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    was tried and imprisoned for
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President's
    </span>
    involvement in underground armed resistance activities.
    The armed struggle was a last resort;
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mandela
    </span>
    had remained steadfastly committed to non-violence.
    Through
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    </span>
    27-year imprisonment, much of it spent in a cell on Robben Island,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     this first President
    </span>
    became the most widely known figure in the struggle against South African apartheid.
    Although the apartheid regime and nations sympathetic to it considered
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mandela
    </span>
    and the ANC to be communists and terrorists, the armed struggle was an integral part of the overall campaign against apartheid.
    The switch in policy to that of reconciliation, which

    pursued upon
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
