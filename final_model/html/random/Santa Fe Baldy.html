    The western slopes are drained by the Rio Capulin and the Rio Nambe, both flowing to the Rio Grande.

    is accessed by Trail 251, the Skyline Trail, which climbs to a saddle about 1,000 ft (300 m) below the summit; the remaining distance is covered by a steep unofficial trail along the ridgeline.
    Under good conditions the summit is a simple "walk-up" climb, but the Sangre de Cristos are unusually prone to lightning, and during the summer months, the wise hiker is off
