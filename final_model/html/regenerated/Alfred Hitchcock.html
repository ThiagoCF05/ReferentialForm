    films draw heavily on both fear and fantasy, and are known for their droll humour.
    They often portray innocent people caught up in circumstances beyond their control or understanding.
    This often involves a transference of guilt in which the "innocent" character's failings are transferred to another character, and magnified.
    Another common theme is the basic incompatibility of men and women;
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    films often take a cynical view of traditional romance.

    career,

    was far more popular with film audiences than with film critics, especially the elite British and American critics.
    In the late 1950s the French New Wave critics, especially &Eacute;ric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol, and Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut, were among the first to see and promote
