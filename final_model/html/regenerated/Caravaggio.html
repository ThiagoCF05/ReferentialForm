     Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio
    </span>
    (29 September 1571 &ndash; 18 July 1610) was an Italian artist active in Rome, Naples, Malta and Sicily between 1593 and 1610.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    is commonly placed in the Baroque school, of which
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    was the first great representative.

     Caravaggio's
    </span>
    own lifetime
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    was considered enigmatic, fascinating, and dangerous.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    burst upon the Rome art scene in 1600, and thereafter

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his

    success atrociously.
    An early published notice on
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Caravaggio
    </span>
    , dating from 1604 and describing
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    lifestyle some three years previously, tells how "after a fortnight's work he will swagger about for a month or two with a sword at his side and a servant following him, from one ball-court to the next, ever ready to engage in a fight or an argument, so that it is most awkward to get along with him."
    In 1606
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Caravaggio
    </span>
    killed a young man in a brawl and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    fled from Rome with a price on
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    head.
    In Malta in 1608
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Caravaggio
    </span>
    was involved in another brawl, and yet another in Naples in 1609, possibly a deliberate attempt on
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    life by unidentified enemies.
    By the next year, after a career of little more than a decade,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    was dead.

    Huge new churches and palazzi were being built in Rome in the decades of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and paintings were needed to fill them.
    The Counter-Reformation Church searched for authentic religious art with which to counter the threat of Protestantism, and for this task the artificial conventions of Mannerism, which had ruled art for almost a century, no longer seemed adequate.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    novelty was a radical naturalism which combined close physical observation with a dramatic, even theatrical, approach to chiaroscuro, the use of light and shadow.
    In
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his

    hands this new style was the vehicle for authentic and moving spirituality.

    Famous and extremely influential while
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Caravaggio

    lived,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    was almost completely forgotten in the centuries after
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    death, and it was only in the 20th century that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his

    importance to the development of Western art was rediscovered.
    Yet despite this
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    influence on the common style which eventually emerged from the ruins of Mannerism, the new Baroque, was profound.
    Andre Berne-Joffroy, Paul Val&eacute;ry&rsquo;s secretary, said of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    : "What begins in the work of Caravaggio is, quite simply, modern painting."
