    (742 or 747 - 28 January 814) (also Charles the Great; from Latin, [Latin: Carolus Magnus]) was the King of the Franks (768-814) who conquered Italy and took the Iron Crown of Lombardy in 774 and, on a visit to Rome in 800, was crowned [Latin: imperator Romanorum] ("Emperor of the Romans") by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day, presaging the revival of the Roman imperial tradition in the West in the form of the Holy Roman Empire.
