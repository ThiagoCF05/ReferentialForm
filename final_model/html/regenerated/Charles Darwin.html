     Charles Robert Darwin

    FRS (12 February 1809 - 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     who
    </span>
    achieved lasting fame by producing considerable evidence that species originated through evolutionary change, at the same time proposing the scientific theory that natural selection is the mechanism by which such change occurs.
    This theory is now considered a cornerstone of biology, and has significantly affected other disciplines such as philosophy, psychology and anthropology.

    However, in 1858 the information that Alfred Russel Wallace had developed a similar theory forced an early joint publication of the theory.
