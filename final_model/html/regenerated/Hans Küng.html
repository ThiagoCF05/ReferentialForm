     Hans K&uuml;ng
    </span>
    (born March 19, 1928 in Sursee, Canton of Lucerne), is a Catholic priest, an eminent Swiss theologian, and a prolific author.
    Since 1995
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    has been President of the Foundation for a Global Ethic (Stiftung Weltethos).
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     The Catholic priest
    </span>
    remains a Catholic priest, but the Vatican has rescinded
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    authority to teach Catholic theology.
    Though
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    had to leave the Catholic faculty,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    remained at the University as a professor of Ecumenical Theology.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">

    studied theology and philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    was ordained in 1954.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     He
    </span>
    then continued
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    education in various European cities, including the Sorbonne in Paris.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     His
    </span>
    doctoral thesis was entitled "Justification.
    La doctrine de Karl Barth et une r&eacute;flexion catholique."
    Published in English in 1964, it located a number of areas of agreement between Barthian and Catholic theologies of justification, concluding that the differences were not fundamental and did not warrant a division in the Church.
    (The book included a letter from Karl Barth, attesting that he agreed with
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    representation of his theology.)
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    In 1960
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     K&uuml;ng
    </span>
    was appointed professor of theology at Eberhard Karls University, T&uuml;bingen, Germany.
    Just like
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    colleague Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI), in 1962
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    was appointed peritus by Pope John XXIII, serving as an expert theological advisor to members of the Second Vatican Council until its conclusion in 1965.
    At
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    instigation, the Catholic Faculty at T&uuml;bingen appointed Ratzinger as professor of dogmatics.
    However, due to the 1968 students revolt, Ratzinger moved to the university of Regensburg, ending the cooperation between the two.

   <p class="lead">
    In the late 1960s
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    became the first major Roman Catholic theologian after the late 19th century Old Catholic Church schism to reject the doctrine of papal infallibility, in particular in
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    book Infallible?
    An Inquiry (1971).
    Consequently, on December 18, 1979,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    was stripped of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    license to teach as a Roman Catholic theologian but
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     _
    </span>
    carried on teaching as a tenured professor of ecumenical theology at the University of T&uuml;bingen until
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    retirement (Emeritierung) in 1996.
    To this day
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    remains a persistent critic of papal authority, which
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    claims is man-made (and thus reversible) rather than instituted by God.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     K&uuml;ng
    </span>
    was not excommunicated and
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    </span>
    remains a Roman Catholic priest.

   <p class="lead">
    In the early 1990s
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     K&uuml;ng
    </span>
    initiated a project called Weltethos (Global Ethic), which is an attempt at describing what the world religions have in common (rather than what separates them) and at drawing up a minimal code of rules of behaviour everyone can accept.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     K&uuml;ng's
    </span>
    vision of a global ethic was embodied in the document for which
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    wrote the initial draft, Towards a Global Ethic: An Initial Declaration.
    This Declaration was signed at the 1993 Parliament of the World's Religions by many religious and spiritual leaders from around the world.
    Later
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    project would culminate into the UN's "Dialogue among Civilizations" to which
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     K&uuml;ng
    </span>
    was assigned as one of 19 "eminent persons."
    Even though completed shortly after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 (in November 2001), there was no coverage in the U.S. media, something about which
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     K&uuml;ng

    complained.
