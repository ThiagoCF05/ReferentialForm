    The most popular base from which to begin ascent of

     the mountain

    is Guanella Pass, located to the west.
    From Guanella Pass, it is an approximately hike of 3 miles, with a climb of 2,391 feet.
    The trail passes descends slightly into the fairly level marshlands surrounding Scott Gomer Creek before reaching

    western slopes.
    On the rocky upper regions of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Bierstadt
    </span>
    the route of the trail is marked by a series of cairns.
    The trail levels about 200 feet below the summit at saddle point before beginning the final ascent.
    Alternative trails cover the eastern slopes for longer hikes.

   <p class="lead">
    Once at the summit, a popular option is to continue the hike to nearby Mount Evans along a ridge known as The Sawtooth, an intermediate-level hike.
    Often such a trip will involve a detour down to Abyss Lake (12,650 ft elevation), which occupies the bottom of the valley separating

    and Evans.
