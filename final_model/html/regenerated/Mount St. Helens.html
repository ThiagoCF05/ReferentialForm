    is most famous for
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     its
    </span>
    catastrophic eruption on May 18, 1980, which was the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in the history of the United States.
    Fifty-seven people were killed; 250 homes, 47 bridges, 15 miles (24 km) of railways, and 185 miles (300 km) of highway were destroyed.
    The eruption caused a massive debris avalanche, reducing the elevation of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     its
    </span>
    summit from 9,677 feet (2,950 m) to 8,365 feet (2,550 m) and replacing it with a mile-wide (1.5 km-wide) horseshoe-shaped crater.
    The debris avalanche was up to 0.7 cubic miles (2.9 km&sup3;) in volume.
    The Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument was created to preserve

    As with most other volcanoes in the Cascade Range,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Mount St. Helens
    </span>
    is a large eruptive cone consisting of lava rock interlayered with ash, pumice, and other deposits.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     It
    </span>
    includes layers of basalt and andesite through which several domes of dacite lava have erupted.
    The largest of the dacite domes formed the previous summit, and off its northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome.
    Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption.
