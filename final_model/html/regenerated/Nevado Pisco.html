    is a mountain in Peru, located in the Cordillera Blanca about 60 km north of Huaraz.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

    was first climbed in July 12, 1951 by C. Kojan, G.Kojan, R.Leininger and M. Lenoir.

    easy climb.
    Due to global warming and the resulting retreat of glaciers worldwide, a large piece of the glacier broke away in 2004.
    As a result,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Pisco
    </span>
    is no longer the easy climb

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     It
    </span>
    is now rated an AD-.
    It is predicted that
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Pisco

    will get more difficult as the glacier continues to recede.

    There are a multitude of companies in Huaraz offering guided climbs of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Pisco
    </span>
    , which usually include all equipment, food, transport, guide, and possibly a porter.
    The normal route is from the road to the south, up to the col to the west, then to the summit.
    There are two camps on
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     it
    </span>
    and one at
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     its
    </span>
    base, although climbers often only use one.
    The first is next to the road and river on the valley floor.
    The second is in or next to Refugio Per&uacute; (at 4,765 m).
    The third, called the 'moraine camp' lies just below the ice of the first glacier.
    Most parties travel from Huaraz and climb to the moraine camp in one day, then summit and return to Huaraz the next.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    Climbing involves mostly walking on snow slopes up to 35 degrees, but there is one section of about 100m of steep ice.
    Views from
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the mountain
    </span>
    are superb, encompassing many of the other well known mountains of the Cordillera Blanca, such as Huascar&aacute;n, Chopicalqui, Artesonraju, and Alpamayo.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    The altitude makes the climb very difficult for anyone not well acclimatised or fit, and even those who are will be slowed down.
    Sleeping at the two high camps is also difficult.
