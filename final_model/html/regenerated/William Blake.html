     William Blake
    </span>
    (November 28 1757-August 12 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker.
    Largely unrecognised during
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    lifetime,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    work is today considered seminal and significant in the history of both poetry and the visual arts.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    According to Northrop Frye, who undertook a study of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    entire poetic corpus,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    prophetic poems form "what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language."
    Others have praised
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    visual artistry, at least one modern critic proclaiming
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     the English poet
    </span>
    "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced."
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    While
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Blake's
    </span>
    visual art and written poetry are usually considered separately,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    often employed them in concert to create a product that at once defied and superseded convention.
    Though
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    believed
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    able to converse aloud with Old Testament prophets, and despite
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    work in illustrating the Book of Job,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    affection for the Bible was belied by
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    hostility for the church,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    beliefs modified by a fascination with Mysticism and the unfolding of the Romantic movement around
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    .
    Ultimately, the difficulty of placing
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    in any one chronological stage of art history is perhaps the distinction that best defines
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     him
    </span>
    .
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    Once considered mad for
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Blake's
    </span>
    single-mindedness,
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     he
    </span>
    is highly regarded today for
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    expressiveness and creativity, and the philosophical vision that underlies
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     his
    </span>
    work.
    As
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Blake himself
    </span>
    once indicated, "The imagination is not a State: it is the Human existence itself."
