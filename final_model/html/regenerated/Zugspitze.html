     The Zugspitze

    is the highest mountain in Germany.
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     It
    </span>
    is located at the Austrian border in the town of Grainau of the district of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Bavaria.
    On the Austrian side is the town of Ehrwald in the district of Reutte, Tyrol.
    There is a cog railway (Zugspitzbahn ) leading from the tourist resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen to the peak.
    There are also two cable cars that go to the peak from the base: one ascends from the German side of

     it
    </span>
    at the Eibsee (Eibsee Aerial Tramway), and the other ascends from Austria (Tiroler Zugspitzbahn ).
    The peak is regularly crowded with tourists.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    For those wishing to reach the summit under their own power, various hiking and ski trails can also be followed to the top.
    Hiking to the top from the base takes between one and two days.
    Food and lodging is available on some trails.
    In winter
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Zugspitze
    </span>
    is a popular skiing destination, with several slopes on both sides.
    The Zugspitzplatt is the highest ski resort of Germany and thus has enough snow all winter.

    The border between Germany and Austria goes right through

    There used to be a border checkpoint at the summit.
    But since Germany and Austria are now both part of the Schengen zone, the border crossing is no longer staffed.

    For more than a hundred years now, the summit has also had a weather station, which nowadays also gathers data for the Global Atmosphere Watch.

    Shortly after WW II the USA military took over the Schneefernerhaus (as the hotel at the top was then called) for the exclusive use of USA military and civilian employees.
    Room rates, including meals, were US$1/day.
    Ski lessons were available, taught by Austrians and Germans, at a cost of USD$ 0.25 (25 cents) per hour.

   <p class="lead">
    The first recorded ascent to the summit was accomplished by a team of land surveyors on 27 August 1820.
    The team was led by Lieutenant Josef Naus, who was accompanied by two men named Maier and G. Deutschl.
    However, local people had conquered

    Climbing up
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
     Zugspitze
    </span>
    can involve several routes.
    The difference in elevation between Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the summit is 2 200 m, making the climb a challenge even for trained mountaineers.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    On the German side, from Garmisch-Partenkirchen, climbers go either through the H&ouml;llental ("Valley of Hell") or the Reintal.
    The way through the Reintal is the easiest, but also the longest and takes 8 to 10 hours.
    This path goes through the Partnachklamm, a scenic gorge, then through the Reintal up to the Zugspitzplatt, a barren plateau.
    from there up to the summit.
    Climbers can stay for the night at two Alpine huts, the "Reintalangerh&uuml;tte" or the "Knorrh&uuml;tte".
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    The more popular, but harder route is through the H&ouml;llental.
    It starts at Hammersbach near Garmisch, goes through the H&ouml;llentalklamm, a similar gorge up to the "H&ouml;llentalangerh&uuml;tte", where one can take a meal or stay for the night.
    It then crosses the H&ouml;llentalferner, the remnants of a small glacier.
    After that it traverses a wall with the help of iron ladders and steps.
    Via ferrata equipment is recommended for that part.
    Over the Irmerscharte (a gap) it reaches the summit.
    This path should take 7 to 8 hours.
   </p>
   <p class="lead">
    From the Austrian village of Ehrwald, there are also two variants.
    One goes straight through the Western Flank, which is the shortest route overall, but rather hard.
    It includes a via ferrata, and there is a hut called "Wiener Neust&auml;dter H&uuml;tte" by the Austrian Alpine Club.
    An easier path leads via the Ehrwalder Alm, across a small pass called "Gatterl", joining the Reintal path at the Knorrh&uuml;tte.

     Zugspitze's

    exact height was a matter of debate for quite a while.
    Given figures ranged from 2 960 m to 2 970 m, but it is now generally accepted that the peak is 2 962 m above sea level as a result of a survey carried out by the Bavarian land survey office.
    The lounge at the new caf&eacute; is named "2962" for this reason.
