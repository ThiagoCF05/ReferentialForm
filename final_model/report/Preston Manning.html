     formed the Reform Party in 1987.
     <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
      His
     </span>
     chief policy adviser was Stephen Harper, a student at the University of Calgary and now the Prime Minister of Canada.
     Harper designed the Reform Party's 1988 campaign platform.
     The Reform Party was a combination of fiscal conservatism and populism, though aspects of social-conservatism grew, branding the party as "very right-wing."
     All of the Reform Party's candidates were defeated in the 1988 federal election.
     However, the first Reform Member of Parliament, Deborah Grey was elected in a Federal by-election in 1989 at Beaver River, Alberta.
     <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
      Manning
     </span>
     was elected to the House of Commons in the 1993 federal election, when Reform experienced its first major electoral success, replacing the Progressive Conservative Party as Canada's dominant conservative party, with a base especially in Western Canada.
     In the 1997 election, the party became Canada's official opposition, with
     <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
      Manning
     </span>
     becoming the Leader of the Opposition.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
     With Reform's emergence, however,
     <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
      Manning
     </span>
     fragmented the conservative vote into two parts - Reform and the weakened PC Party.
     With Canada's plurality voting system, the result was political domination by the Liberal Party.
     Consequently,
     <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
      Manning's
     </span>
     new goal was to reunite the two conservative parties under
     <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

     leadership, and
     <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
      he
     </span>
     launched the United Alternative movement to examine ways for the parties to cooperate.
     The movement resulted in the formation of a new party, the Canadian Alliance, which as its full name (Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance) shows, was intended to supplant both parties.
     Most of the PC Party, however, refused to cooperate, and critics claimed the new party was little more than an image makeover for the Reform Party.
