     The standard route ascends from the north side, and boasts relatively easy access, with vehicle travel possible to base camp at 5,000 metres (16,400 feet).
     More technically demanding are the routes on the steeper Southwest Face, which involve 2,200 metres (7,218 feet) of ascent on a 50 degree slope.
     These are ideal for a (difficult) alpine style ascent.
     In 2004, Jean-Christophe Lafaille roused some controversy when he climbed a route on this face, solo, in mid-December, and claimed a winter ascent.
     Since this was not technically calendar winter, he later changed his claim to an ascent "in winter conditions."
